# Batch Configuration Example
# This file defines a batch experiment that runs multiple scenario variations

experiment_name: "Model Comparison - Regulation Negotiation"
description: |
  Compare how different LLM models behave in AI regulation negotiation scenario.
  Tests whether more capable models lead to better negotiation outcomes.

# Base scenario to run (all variations will start from this)
base_scenario: "scenarios/test-regulation-negotiation"

# Run configuration
runs_per_variation: 5        # Number of times to run each variation (for statistical significance)
max_parallel: 2              # Maximum concurrent runs (consider API rate limits)
timeout_per_run: 1800        # Maximum seconds per run (30 minutes)

# Cost controls
budget_limit: 10.00          # Maximum spend for entire batch (USD)
cost_per_run_limit: 0.50     # Maximum cost per individual run (USD)

# Variations to test
# Each variation type creates a new dimension in the parameter space
variations:
  # Vary which LLM model the regulator uses
  - type: "actor_model"
    actor: "regulator"
    values:
      - "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
      - "anthropic/claude-3-haiku"

  # Vary which LLM model the tech company uses
  - type: "actor_model"
    actor: "tech-company"
    values:
      - "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
      - "anthropic/claude-3-haiku"

# This creates a 2x2 grid = 4 variations
# With runs_per_variation=5, this is 4 × 5 = 20 total runs

# Output configuration
output_dir: "experiments/model-comparison"
save_individual_runs: true   # Save full output for each run
aggregate_metrics: true      # Generate aggregated analysis

# Optional: Resume configuration
# resume_from: "experiments/model-comparison"  # Resume incomplete batch
