# Test Batch Configuration
# Minimal batch test with free models and few runs

description: "Test batch runner with minimal configuration using free models"

base_scenario: "scenarios/test-regulation-negotiation"

# Minimal configuration for testing
runs_per_variation: 2
max_parallel: 1
timeout_per_run: 600  # 10 minutes

# Cost controls (generous for testing)
budget_limit: 5.00
cost_per_run_limit: 1.00

# Simple variations - just test two different models for one actor
variations:
  - type: "actor_model"
    actor: "regulator"
    values:
      - "alibaba/tongyi-deepresearch-30b-a3b:free"

  - type: "actor_model"
    actor: "tech-company"
    values:
      - "alibaba/tongyi-deepresearch-30b-a3b:free"

# This creates 1x1 = 1 variation with 2 runs = 2 total runs
