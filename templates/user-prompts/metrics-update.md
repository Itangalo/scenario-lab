It is now turn {{turn}} which covers {{time_period}}.

The Metric Rules looked like this (possibly updated):

{{metric_rules}}

The world state at the start of the turn is described as follows:

{% if historical_summary %}
## Previous History
{{historical_summary}}
{% endif %}

## Current Situation ({{time_period_lower}})
{{world_state}}

---

The notepad contains the following information:

{{notepad}}

---

This turn, the following external events have occurred:

{% if triggered_events %}
{{triggered_events}}
{% else %}
None
{% endif %}

---

The actors in the scenario describe their actions as follows:

{{actor_actions}}

---

Use this information to do the following:

* Determine how successful the actors are with their actions. This is based on how the world looks and your assessment of how likely they are to succeed.
* Based on the actors' actions and Metric Rules, determine Metrics for the next turn.
* Write a coherent narrative that tells what happens in the world during this turn.

{% if output_language %}
Please write your response in {{output_language}}.
{% endif %}

Important: You must use the exact headers '## Metrics', '## Narrative', and '## Notepad' as specified below. Do not translate these headers, even if you are writing the content in another language.

Respond with a Markdown text with the following content:

* Heading level 2: Metrics
* A JSON object describing all metrics, in the following format: `{"metric1_name": value1, "metric2_name": value2}`
* Heading level 2: Narrative
* A coherent story about what happens in the world during the turn (max 400 words). You may use subheadings (level 3) if desired.
