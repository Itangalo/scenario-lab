  # International AI Governance Summit - Week 1

  Three major powers have convened for urgent negotiations on global AI safety standards. Recent AI incidents have increased pressure for coordination, but significant disagreements remain.

  ## Proposed Framework Elements

  **Compute Governance:**
  - Track and report training runs above 10^26 FLOPS
  - International registry of frontier AI systems
  - Restrictions on certain high-risk applications

  **Safety Standards:**
  - Mandatory safety testing before deployment
  - Incident reporting requirements
  - Independent audits of frontier systems

  **Enforcement:**
  - Export controls on advanced AI chips
  - Sanctions for non-compliance
  - Information sharing agreements

  ## Current Positions

  **United States:**
  - Supports strong standards but wants flexible implementation
  - Concerned about maintaining AI leadership
  - Open to export controls if China is included

  **European Union:**
  - Advocates for strictest safety standards
  - Willing to sacrifice some competitiveness for safety
  - Wants binding international treaty

  **China:**
  - Rejects intrusive verification measures
  - Supports safety standards in principle
  - Opposes export controls as discriminatory

  ## Summit Dynamics

  - Public statements are being closely watched by industry and civil society
  - Private bilateral meetings are occurring in parallel
  - Potential for 2-nation coalitions to push preferred frameworks
  - Deadline in 3 weeks for preliminary agreement

  The first week of negotiations begins now.
