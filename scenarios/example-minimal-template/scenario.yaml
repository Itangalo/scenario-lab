name: "Community Park Planning"
description: |
  A minimal template scenario demonstrating the basic structure.
  A neighborhood is planning a new community park and stakeholders
  must decide how to use the space.

system_prompt: |
  You are simulating a community planning process for a new 2-acre park.

  The neighborhood association has secured funding for the park, but
  stakeholders have different visions for how the space should be used.

  Key questions:
  - Active recreation (playground, sports) vs. passive (gardens, nature)?
  - Community programs vs. open space?
  - Maintenance responsibilities and costs?

  Make realistic decisions that reflect stakeholder priorities.
