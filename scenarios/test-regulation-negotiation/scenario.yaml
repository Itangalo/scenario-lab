name: "Test AI Regulation Negotiation"
description: "A simple two-actor scenario where a regulator and a tech company negotiate AI safety requirements"

initial_world_state: |
  The year is 2025. A national AI regulator is proposing new safety requirements for
  advanced AI systems. A major tech company developing frontier AI models must respond
  to these proposals. Both parties have agreed to a 3-round negotiation process.

  Key issues on the table:
  - Mandatory safety testing before deployment
  - Incident reporting requirements
  - Third-party auditing of AI systems
  - Compute thresholds that trigger regulation

  The current draft regulation proposes:
  - All systems trained with >10^25 FLOPS must undergo pre-deployment safety testing
  - Incidents must be reported within 24 hours
  - Annual third-party audits required
  - Public disclosure of audit results

turns: 3
turn_duration: "1 month"

actors:
  - regulator
  - tech-company
