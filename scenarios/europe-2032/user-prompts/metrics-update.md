{# Scenario override. Identical to templates/user-prompts/metrics-update.md except for three additions, all after the notepad block:
   1. Guidance for treating tracked emerging developments as faint narrative signals rather than events.
   2. The political-capital procedure: the portfolio charge, the proposal bonus and the sentiment term, each as its own required Notepad line.
   3. The US_POSTURE line, which must be carried in the Notepad from the turn the 2028 election fires onward.
   A ban on writing the long run as settled used to sit here, and was removed on 2026-09-01 deliberately: the Game Master is never told the arm's name and never sees the other arms' rules, so it has no vocabulary for announcing which trajectory this world turned out to be. background/context.md does name the three readings in the opening world state, so the channel is not fully closed -- that was weighed and accepted.
   Keep in sync with the default template when that changes. #}
It is now turn {{turn}} which covers {{time_period}}.

The Metric Rules looked like this (possibly updated):

{{metric_rules}}

The world state at the start of the turn is described as follows:

{% if historical_summary %}
## Previous History
{{historical_summary}}
{% endif %}

## Current Situation ({{time_period_lower}})
{{world_state}}

---

The notepad contains the following information:

{{notepad}}

{% if has_emerging_developments %}
The "Emerging developments (tracked)" section lists developments that recent turns have judged plausible but that have not happened. They are not events. Let them colour the narrative only as faint, ambiguous signals whose visibility grows with how long they have been listed — never as anything confirmed, and never with a stated probability.
{% endif %}

**Five rules bind your output. The first two bind the Narrative specifically, and the first of them overrides any pull toward explanatory convenience:**

1. **Never write an event id in the Narrative.** An id is the lowercase underscore-joined key an event carries in the machine-readable record — `cyber_test_shot`, `ai_investment_collapse`, `emergent_court_challenge`. No newspaper, minister or official has ever used one. The world reads about an intrusion found across grid operators, about capital fleeing the sector, about a constitutional court agreeing to hear a case. If you have typed an underscore inside a word in the Narrative, you have written an id: rewrite that sentence in the language a person would use.

2. Tracked emerging developments are world trends, not happenings: they surface as atmosphere, rumour and single-source reporting whose intensity scales with how long they have been listed.

3. **Price the portfolio, out loud, before you apply it.** Metric rule 6 charges `eu_political_capital` for every measure in flight, every turn, on all of them and not only the priority: 3 for a large measure, 2 for a small one, plus 1 more for whichever is the named priority. **Every term in the charge line is a subtraction, the priority's included.** Write it as `priority −1`: it is a further cost for pushing something, never a rebate, and a `+1` in that line has been read as one.

   Write one line in the Notepad giving every measure its price:

   `PORTFOLIO CHARGE: Gigafactories −3, Frontier Access Guarantee −3, Resilience Surge −2, priority −1 = −9`

   Recompute that total every turn from the portfolio as it now stands. It changes when a measure is added and when one finishes, and a total carried forward unchanged while the portfolio grew is this rule being skipped.

3b. **Then judge the proposal bonus, if this turn's new measure earned one.** A separate, one-off addition to `eu_political_capital` under metric rule 6, paid in the turn a measure is proposed and never again. It does not touch the charge above.

   Ask: **in the last three turns, did anything happen that this measure would have helped with?** Read that off the events themselves: what they were, how severe, and which of them this measure answers. What it is worth is your judgement, on how big the event was, how large the measure is, and how long ago it happened. **Typically +1 to +4**, the top of it for a large measure answering a severe, recent shock directly. Several open arguments pointing at one measure are judged together as a single figure, not summed.

   Write it as its own Notepad line, with the reasoning visible, or `PROPOSAL BONUS: none` when nothing argued for it:

   `PROPOSAL BONUS: Cyber Shield (cat 6, large) +3 — cyber_major_incident landed last turn and this answers it directly`

   Two things this rule is not. It is not a lookup: no table gives you the number, and a figure with no reason beside it is wrong. And it is not automatic: a small measure gesturing at an old event earns +1 or nothing at all, and `none` is the right answer more often than not.

3c. **Last, if this run's metric rules give `eu_political_capital` a term for sentiment sitting above it, apply it.** Only when the rules carry such a line, and only when `public_sentiment` is the higher of the two: add what the rule states, never taking capital past sentiment, after every other term above.

   Write it as its own Notepad line:

   `LEGITIMACY LENDS: capital 18, sentiment 31 -> +2`

   Compare the two numbers before writing anything. `none` is correct only when capital is the higher of the two, and a `none` whose own reasoning shows sentiment above capital is wrong.

4. **A finishing turn moves only when something moved it.** The portfolio carries a stated finishing turn per measure, set when the measure was proposed. Copy them forward as they stand. If a measure's finishing turn should change — pushed by being the priority, slipping through neglect, delayed or accelerated by an event — say so in the Narrative in the same breath as the reason, and write the new turn. A finishing turn that drifts with no reason given is an error.

5. Once `us_election_2028` has fired, write the resulting `US_POSTURE: CONSOLIDATION`, `US_POSTURE: ALLIANCE` or `US_POSTURE: RETRENCHMENT` line into the world state for that turn, and carry the same line in the Notepad every turn thereafter. It is a standing condition of the world that metric rule 8 reads each turn, not a one-off narrative beat.

This turn, the following external events have occurred:

{% if triggered_events %}
{{triggered_events}}
{% else %}
None
{% endif %}

---

The actors in the scenario describe their actions as follows:

{{actor_actions}}

Use this information to do the following:

* Determine how successful the actors are with their actions. This is based on how the world looks and your assessment of how likely they are to succeed.
* Based on the actors' actions and Metric Rules, determine Metrics for the next turn.
* Write a coherent narrative that tells what happens in the world during this turn.

{% if output_language %}
Please write your response in {{output_language}}.

Important: You must use the exact headers '## Metrics', '## Narrative', and '## Notepad' as specified below. Do not translate these headers, even if you are writing the content in another language.

Respond with a Markdown text with the following content:

* Heading level 2: Metrics
* A JSON object describing all metrics in a ```json code fence, in the following format: `{"metric1_name": value1, "metric2_name": value2}`
* Heading level 2: Narrative
* A coherent story about what happens in the world during the turn (max 400 words). You may use subheadings (level 3) if desired.
