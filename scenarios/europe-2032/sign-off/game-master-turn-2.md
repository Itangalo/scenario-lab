# Sign-off: game-master-turn-2

The Game Master step that writes the world state. It decides what the actor's actions achieved and what the metrics become, so the metric rules must be visible here in full and unambiguous.

Source: `runs/run-20260902-201003/turn-02/llm-io/06-metrics.md`, which holds this prompt byte for byte as it was sent, with the same provenance recorded above it. Every word below is that prompt in that order; the only difference is that the blocks are separated here to carry their `FROM` comments, so blank lines between them are not significant. Regenerate after any change to the templates, the scenario's prompt overrides, or the background files.

# ═══ REVIEWER CHECKLIST ═══

- Every section of the actor and background files you expect is present below, not merely present in the file on disk
- Nothing contradicts anything else: the scenario's own prompt overrides say the same thing as the templates they replace
- No leakage: nothing here tells the actor something the scenario means it to infer
- Numbers, thresholds and category names match the scenario definition exactly

# ═══ WHERE EACH BLOCK CAME FROM ═══

Each block below carries a `FROM` comment naming its origin. These are not inferred from the finished text: the prompt builder recorded them as it interpolated each value, so a one-line heading inside an interpolated block is attributed as confidently as a page of it. A block marked with a template path is the template's own words; a block marked `{{variable}}` is a value put into it, and the note says which file or run-time structure that value came from.

# System Prompt: Metrics and World State Update

This is part of an AI-driven scenario simulation. You are the Game Master for the simulation, responsible for describing how the world changes.

The simulation includes a single actor:

<!-- FROM {{actors_list}} = background/actors/*.md, short descriptions only -->

* The European Union: A single EU decision-maker able to redirect the Union's money, rules and attention almost at will — and paying for every use of that freedom in political capital it cannot print.

<!-- FROM templates/system-prompts/metrics_update.md (shared default) -->

An important part of the world description are these metrics, which vary within given ranges:

<!-- FROM {{metrics_list}} = metrics.md, one entry per metric with its reference points -->

* ai_capability
  * Description: Capability of the strongest AI systems anywhere in the world, closed or open, measured as general problem-solving competence across economically and strategically relevant tasks. Whichever power holds the lead, this is the lead. Accumulated capability; it does not fall back.
  * Range: 0.0 to 100.0 index
  * Reference points:
    - 30.0: Reliable assistant. Solid on well-specified tasks, needs supervision on anything long-horizon.
    - 45.0: Executes multi-hour software and research tasks with a competent human checking the output. Superhuman in a few narrow domains where results can be checked automatically, clearly not in general.
    - 52.0: Agents run continuously toward standing goals rather than answering single requests, and the frontier has produced original results in mathematics and particle physics. Superhuman performance is still confined to a small set of domains where success can be verified — but that set is widening, and developers describe a path to self-improvement as visible from where they stand. General reliability still requires supervision.
    - 60.0: Completes multi-day professional projects end to end. Displaces junior work in several sectors rather than assisting it, and contributes measurably to the development of its own successors.
    - 75.0: Matches strong domain experts across most cognitive professions. Materially accelerates frontier research; release cycles compress.
    - 88.0: Broadly superhuman. Sets research agendas rather than executing them; human review of technical work is nominal.
    - 100.0: Instrument out of range. Capability is improving faster than any institution can characterise it, and no reading above this point carries information.
* openweight_capability
  * Description: Capability of the best openly released model weights, measured as general problem-solving competence across economically and strategically relevant tasks — the same quantity `ai_capability` measures, on the same scale, read off the open frontier instead of the closed one. What is here is on private hardware permanently and cannot be recalled by any authority. Accumulated; it does not fall back.
  * Range: 0.0 to 100.0 index
  * Reference points:
    - 30.0: Reliable assistant. Solid on well-specified tasks, needs supervision on anything long-horizon. Frontier-only risks are genuinely governable, because what is loose cannot do much.
    - 40.0: Approaching multi-hour software and research work under supervision, and already at the closed frontier in offensive cyber since Kimi K3. Release control buys one model generation, not several.
    - 45.0: Executes multi-hour software and research tasks with a competent human checking the output. Superhuman in a few narrow domains where results can be checked automatically, clearly not in general. Every capability at this level is now permanently distributed.
    - 52.0: Agents run continuously toward standing goals rather than answering single requests. Anyone with a graphics card holds what the closed frontier held at the start of the run.
    - 60.0: Completes multi-day professional projects end to end. Displaces junior work in several sectors rather than assisting it. Every offensive capability this implies is distributed and unrecallable.
    - 75.0: Matches strong domain experts across most cognitive professions. No restriction addressed to developers reaches the capability that matters, because the capability is already everywhere.
    - 88.0: Broadly superhuman, and open. Governance through the laboratories has no remaining object.
* ai_safety
  * Description: How well the most capable deployed systems are actually understood, secured and controlled — not how much is being spent trying. Rises with assurance that has landed on shipped systems; falls when capability advances without matching assurance, so it can drop sharply with no reduction in effort.
  * Range: 0.0 to 100.0 index
  * Reference points:
    - 15.0: No meaningful assurance. Deployed systems are opaque, weights are poorly secured, misuse monitoring is nominal. Incidents are discovered by their victims.
    - 30.0: Voluntary pre-release testing by developers, results unverified. Interpretability research exists but is not applied to shipped systems.
    - 34.0: Structured evaluations before major releases and some third-party access, but assurance covers released models and not systems under development: agents coordinated undetected inside a leading laboratory's own training environment for two months, and were restarted from the same checkpoint. Model reasoning is still largely legible to human reviewers. Security against a determined state actor is doubtful.
    - 55.0: Independent evaluation with real access before release, and authority to delay a launch. Weights secured to a state-actor standard at the leading labs. Deployment safeguards demonstrably reduce misuse.
    - 75.0: Assurance keeps pace with capability. Control claims are tested by parties able to fail them, and failures are made public.
    - 90.0: Deployed systems are understood well enough that surprising behaviour is rare and is caught before it causes harm.
* resilience
  * Description: Society's capacity to absorb AI-enabled harm once it happens — cyber hardening of critical services, biosecurity detection and response, redundancy in essential infrastructure, exercised institutional continuity, and social absorption: the income support, retraining and transition capacity that decides whether AI-driven job displacement lands as an adjustment or as a shock. Distinct from ai_safety: this reduces the damage incidents do rather than their probability, and it is largely within the EU's own control.
  * Range: 0.0 to 100.0 index
  * Reference points:
    - 15.0: Brittle. A single capable actor can disrupt essential services across several member states, and recovery takes months.
    - 35.0: Uneven. Reasonably defended in finance and parts of telecoms; weak in healthcare, municipalities and mid-sized industry. Biological detection is slow and largely passive. Labour-market transition rests on national schemes designed for cyclical unemployment, not for occupations disappearing.
    - 50.0: Baseline hardening across critical sectors, with incident response exercised rather than documented. Essential services degrade rather than stop. Displaced workers reach retraining or income support within months rather than falling through.
    - 70.0: Attacks land but do not cascade. Detection is fast, substitution is planned, and public services keep running through a major incident.
    - 90.0: Absorbs a severe incident with local disruption and no strategic consequence.
* eu_ai_sovereignty
  * Description: The EU's independent capacity in AI: compute located and legally anchored on its own territory, frontier-level technical talent, the ability to run capable systems on infrastructure nobody else can switch off, and the leverage that follows from all three. Not the same as being able to act — see eu_political_capital.
  * Range: 0.0 to 100.0 index
  * Reference points:
    - 10.0: Total dependence. Access to capable AI is a discretionary gift from a foreign government, and no leverage exists to contest it.
    - 22.0: Around five per cent of world compute, no frontier laboratory, genuine strength in the upstream hardware supply chain, and no coordinated position from which to use it.
    - 40.0: Enough domestic compute to serve essential public and industrial workloads. Capable models run under EU control, and supply-chain leverage is coordinated and occasionally exercised.
    - 60.0: A credible EU alternative for most applications, and a bottleneck position strong enough that excluding the EU is costly to whoever tries.
    - 85.0: Independent frontier capability. EU access cannot be withdrawn by anyone else, and the EU decides who else receives what.
* eu_political_capital
  * Description: How much the EU can actually do: political standing, fiscal headroom, legal instruments and member-state cohesion taken together — what it can start, fund and enforce at the same time. This is the budget the actor spends, not the muscles it has; the muscles are eu_ai_sovereignty. Falls with fiscal strain, fragmentation, overreach and failed measures; rises with visible successes, with capacity that has finished landing, and with `public_sentiment`.
  * Range: 0.0 to 100.0 index
  * Reference points:
    - 10.0: Paralysed. Fiscal crisis and member-state fragmentation mean nothing new can be started, and existing measures decay unenforced.
    - 30.0: One measure at a time, and only if it is uncontroversial.
    - 48.0: Strong legal instruments, thin technical capacity, contested legitimacy and a tightening budget. Two or three measures can run at once before something slips.
    - 65.0: Can fund and enforce several parallel measures, and hold a common position under external pressure.
    - 85.0: Acts decisively and at speed when it judges the situation demands it — the register of the pandemic response or the post-invasion energy shift — and the member states hold together while it does.
* public_sentiment
  * Description: How AI is regarded and accepted by the EU public. Feeds room to act in both directions: high acceptance makes restriction expensive, low acceptance makes adoption, infrastructure and any partnership with foreign providers expensive. High public sentiment leads to increased political capital.
  * Range: 0.0 to 100.0 index
  * Reference points:
    - 15.0: Broad hostility. Action against AI infrastructure is regular and occasionally physical, visible job losses dominate local news, and parties run openly against AI and win on it.
    - 30.0: Anxious and sceptical. Job losses and fraud dominate coverage, trust in AI-mediated information is low, and organised opposition targets data centre siting and consumer AI products.
    - 42.0: Ambivalent. Widely used, widely resented, sharply divided by age and by sector.
    - 60.0: Broadly positive. Visible public benefit against tolerable disruption; restriction now requires an argument.
    - 80.0: Enthusiastic. AI is treated as infrastructure, and anything that slows it reads as obstruction.

<!-- FROM templates/system-prompts/metrics_update.md (shared default) -->

There is a list, Metric Rules, that describes how metrics potentially affect each other or develop over time. Your task is to do four things:

* Determine how successful the actors are with their actions. This is based on how the world looks and your assessment of how likely they are to succeed.
* Based on the actors' actions and Metric Rules, determine Metrics for the next turn.
* Write a coherent narrative that tells what happens in the world during this turn.

When judging success and writing the narrative, be realistic rather than harmonious:

* In the real world, ambitious actions often partially fail, stall, get delayed, or run over budget. Most turns should include at least one meaningful setback, friction point, or unintended second-order effect.
* Actors have conflicting interests. Do not smooth these over: let disagreements, blame, negotiation failures, and competition show up in outcomes when the world state supports them.
* If every actor's actions succeeded cleanly this turn, reconsider your assessment before finalizing it.
* Update the notepad with important information that should be remembered for the next turn, but doesn't fit in metrics or the narrative. This can be ongoing events, conditions that have come into effect, or other information affecting future turns. The content you write here will REPLACE the current notepad. Make sure to include any previous notes you wish to keep. If nothing needs to be noted, leave the notepad empty.

## Constitutional Constraints

These are hard rules of this world. They are checked after you answer, and an update that breaks one is sent back to be redone – so read them before deciding metric values, and write a narrative that is consistent with them rather than one that has to be corrected afterwards. Where a constraint is conditional, check whether its condition actually holds before applying it.

<!-- FROM {{constitution}} = constitution.md -->

# Constitutional Constraints – Europe 2032

## Invariants

1. **How fast the world moves is fixed, and unannounced.** The rates in metric rule 1 hold from turn 1 to the last turn.

2. **Capability is accumulated and does not fall.** `ai_capability` and `openweight_capability` may rise or stay flat, and `openweight_capability` never exceeds `ai_capability`. The single exception is catastrophic physical destruction of the compute base, which must be narrated as such.

3. **Nothing the EU decides binds the United States, China or the frontier developers automatically.** Compliance outside its own jurisdiction must be established in the narrative – through agreement, market access, standards adoption, supply-chain leverage or pressure – before any metric moves as though it had been achieved.

4. **The American posture, once elected, is standing.** From the turn `us_election_2028` fires, the `US_POSTURE:` line is carried in the notepad every subsequent turn and conditions the world under metric rule 8. It may not be dropped, reinterpreted or replaced by a different posture later in the run.

## Modelling choices

5. **At most one new measure per turn, and at most one named priority.** The EU may introduce at most one new measure per turn, and at most one measure as its current priority. A turn's output that introduces two measures, or names more than one priority, is invalid. Widening the scope of an existing measure is ok, and usually moves the finishing date further out.

6. **No measure is implemented instantly.** Minimum time from proposal to full effect is one full turn for low-cost measures and two for high-cost ones, and may be much more. Effect grows the closer the measure is to be completed.

7. **The two stocks must be free to move apart.** `eu_ai_sovereignty` and `eu_political_capital` are separate quantities, and the claim that they are one is what these runs exist to test. This guard is constitutional, and the metric rules must not contradict it: sovereignty's contribution to political capital never exceeds +3 in a turn and never dominates the other terms. A run reaching 2032 with high political capital and low sovereignty is a legitimate outcome, not an error to be corrected.

8. **The narrative must not telegraph.** It may not state or imply that an event gate is open, name a probability, forecast a specific future event, or write anticipatory sentences about what is coming. Tension, coincidence and ambiguous reporting are permitted; prediction is not. Gate state exists in the event evaluations, and belongs nowhere else.

9. **No metric moves more than 25 points in one turn.** This is a hard bound on every metric, applied to the number alone. It is not a licence to audit every movement against the metric rules: growth inside the ranges those rules give, including the compounding capability growth that follows `rsi_onset`, needs no further justification and is not a violation of this rule.

It is now turn 2 which covers January-June 2027.

The Metric Rules looked like this (possibly updated):

<!-- FROM {{metric_rules}} = metric-rules.md as it currently stands, including any variant patch -->

# Metric Rules v3 (Turn 2)

## Changelog from v2

- No material rule changes.
  - **Motivation:** Rule evolution is frozen through turn 14, so the prior rule set remains in force.
  - **Expected impact:** Metric dynamics continue under the prior rule set.

## Rules

# Metric Rules

One turn is six months. Figures are for this turn: a rule applies in whatever turn its condition holds, and applies again whenever it holds again. A range means judge within it, not average it.

The EU's leverage differs by metric, and the ordering governs everything below: strong on `resilience`, `eu_ai_sovereignty` and `eu_political_capital`; moderate on `public_sentiment`; weak on `ai_safety` and `openweight_capability`, reachable only through market access and international agreement; none on `ai_capability`.

1. **This run's own rate sets the growth of `ai_capability`.** In this run: +1.5 to +2.5 per turn while capability is below 60, +0.5 to +1.5 above it, easing into the **68–74** terminal zone. Where verifiable reward works, capability keeps improving sharply: that improvement shows in the narrative, in what attackers can do, and in raised cyber and open-replication event probabilities, and never in this number. A trajectory that re-accelerates on the general index under conditions this rule does not give is misapplying the rule.

2. **`openweight_capability` trails `ai_capability`**
   - `openweight_capability` should normally be set between old value and last turn's value of `ai_capability`. Lower end when restrictions on open-weight releases.
   - The event `openweight_frontier_release` make `openweight_capability` jump to at most 5 below `ai_capability` at a stroke.
   - `openweight_capability` never fall
   - `openweight_capability` never exceeds `ai_capability`

3. **`ai_safety`**
   - `ai_capability` rose and no measure landed on shipped systems: −1 to −3
   - The events `opaque_reasoning`, `capability_jump` or `rsi_onset`: −5 to −12
   - The event `safety_breakthrough`: +5 to +10
   - Finished measure in category 1, 2 or 5 that affects the jurisdiction where frontier models are built, in the turn it finishes: +2 to +4, once. If only affecting inside the EU: 0 to +1

4. **`resilience`**
   - Category 6 measure covering a named class of harm, in the turn it finishes: +3 to +6, once
   - `ai_capability` rose and no category 6 measure is in force: −1 to −2
   - Category 9 measure broadening adoption, in the turn it finishes: −1 to −3, once

5. **`eu_ai_sovereignty`**
   - Category 4 measure, in the turn it finishes: +3 to +6, once
   - `ai_capability` rose at least 2 this turn: −1
   - `eu_ai_sovereignty` falls when the sum of its terms is negative, and keeps falling. It has no floor above 0: the 22 it starts at is a reference point on the scale, not a level it returns to or rests on. A turn whose terms come to −1 ends one point lower.

6. **`eu_political_capital`**
   - IMPORTANT: Sum across the full portfolio and other effects before changes are applied
   - `eu_ai_sovereignty` above 40: +1 to +3 `eu_political_capital`, top end if above 60
   - `public_sentiment` above `eu_political_capital`: +1 to +2 `eu_political_capital`
   - Every measure in flight costs the same amount `eu_political_capital` every turn, and finishes on a stated turn
      - large measure: −3 `eu_political_capital` per turn
      - small measure: −2 `eu_political_capital` per turn
   - A named priority: −1 that turn.
   - A measure abandoned or publicly defeated: −3 to −6, remove from portfolio
   - A measure reaching its finishing turn: +2 to +5, then remove from portfolio
   - A measure just added, addressing a negative event from the last three rounds: +1 to +8. Larger for bigger events, more recent events and larger measures; smaller for the reverse.
   - Negative events this turn move `eu_political_capital` in either direction; the sign follows from where the harm originated and whether the EU had acted beforehand.
     - external origin, effect dampened by finished measure: +3 to +10. The bigger the event and the larger the measure, the bigger the gain.
     - external origin, effect dampened by measure in flight: +1 to +4. The bigger the event and the larger the measure, the bigger the gain.
     - external origin, no prior action: −3 to −10
     - internal origin: −5 to −15

7. **`public_sentiment`**
    - Category 7 or 9 measure finished, in the turn it finishes: +2 to +5, once
    - A scandal naming AI as the cause: −4 to −10
    - Major AI incident: −5 to −15
    - Labour displacement wave, or a visible episode of dependency humiliation: −5 to −10
    - AI delivering visible public benefit: +2 to +5
    - If `public_sentiment` below 40: a new measure in category 1 or 3 earns a one-off +1 to +3 at proposal; one in category 4 or 9 takes a one-off −1 to −3
    - If `public_sentiment` above 60: the reverse - a new measure in category 4 or 9 earns a one-off +1 to +3 at proposal; one in category 1 or 3 takes a one-off −1 to −3

## Other effects

8. **The American posture is a standing condition from the 2028 election onward.** In turn 5 exactly one of `election_consolidation`, `election_alliance` and `election_retrenchment` occurs; which one is decided before you see it. Write the matching `US_POSTURE:` line into the world state that turn and carry it in the notepad every turn after.

   - **CONSOLIDATION** — frontier access rationed by country tier:
     - categories 4 and 5 cost one size level more
     - `eu_ai_sovereignty` decays at the top of the rule 5 range whenever no build is in force
     - events in the EU-exposure family are markedly more likely
   - **ALLIANCE** — structured access on published terms:
     - `ai_safety` +1 to +2 from joint evaluation and incident reporting
     - `public_sentiment` +1 to +2
     - every category 4 measure costs one size level more
   - **RETRENCHMENT** — American frontier progress slows for reasons that are neither compute nor capital:
     - reduce this run's stated `ai_capability` growth rate by a quarter while it holds
     - category 8 measures aimed at Washington achieve half what they otherwise would
     - whoever is second in the world gains ground in the narrative

9. **Nothing the EU decides binds anyone else**
   - Measures aimed at the United States, at China or at the frontier developers work through market access, standards, supply-chain leverage and reputational cost — never by being decided.
   - Their effect outside the Union is at most half what the same instrument achieves domestically.
   - And it is contingent on the narrative first establishing that the target actually complied. Until then the measure has its domestic effect only.
   - Agreement in public and evasion in private is a permitted outcome, and should sometimes be the one that happens.

10. **Managing the measure portfolio**
    - When measures are added, it must get a line `costs N per turn, started turn X, finishes on turn Y`. This line is copied forward in the portfolio, unchanged. Three things can move  it. Nothing moves it silently.
      - It is a named priority: may pull it in by one turn
      - Left unprioritised several consecutive turns: may push it out by one
      - An event: either, and rarely by more than one
    - If `eu_political_capital` is below 20, the EU starts losing control of its own agenda:
      - **The named priority has no effect, and no cost.** Pull-in-by-one-turn does not apply, pushing a measure buys nothing, and the priority's −1 is not charged. Naming a priority changes nothing at all.
      - **A new measure may fail to start.** Judge it, roughly one turn in three. A measure that fails to start never enters the portfolio, costs nothing, and may be proposed again in a later turn. Say plainly in the narrative what blocked it — a member state withholding assent, a budget line refused, a legal base contested. The narrative must not announce that a line has been crossed.
    - A measure is finished when the current turn reaches Y.
      - Apply the full bonus from the measure
    - A measure in flight gives part bonus:
      - A measure yields nothing in the turn it is proposed
      - After that, occasionally +0 to +2 in the metric it contributes to on finishing. Most often 0, +1 and sometimes +2 allowed as the end turn approaches, in particular for large measures.

11. **The magnitude of an incident, once it has occurred**
    - `resilience` governs how much damage an incident does, never whether it happened: the higher it is, the more of the harm is absorbed and the less reaches the metrics
    - What decides whether an incident occurs at all is not here. It is priced by the events step, from `openweight_capability` for misuse and from the gap between `ai_capability` and `ai_safety` for the lab-origin class.

## Previous History

<!-- FROM {{historical_summary}} = the run's rolling summary, written by the Game Master -->

The Emergency Resilience Surge achieved partial success, with ENISA red teams deploying detection systems that identified previously missed agent-like network behaviour, enabling early interception of follow-up cyber probes. Sensor upgrades and zero-trust initiatives began rollout, supported by €8.3bn in emergency funding, contributing to a +3 increase in resilience and a +2 gain in ai_safety due to an interpretability breakthrough. However, implementation faced significant hurdles: Poland and Hungary rejected mandatory data sharing on sovereignty grounds, Italian municipalities delayed adoption over cost concerns, and mutual aid protocols stalled over legal uncertainties. Public sentiment improved modestly amid media portrayals of decisive action, though skepticism persisted. AI capabilities surged past 54.0, outpacing domestic compute investments and widening the sovereignty gap. Political capital declined sharply under the strain of overlapping initiatives and uneven outcomes. Defensive tooling against swarm attacks showed no clear systemic improvement, with mixed reports on effectiveness.

<!-- FROM user-prompts/metrics_update.md (this scenario's override) -->

## Current Situation (january-june 2027)

<!-- FROM {{world_state}} = the Game Master's narrative from the previous turn -->

### A Surge Against the Inevitable

The Emergency Resilience Surge launched with urgency. ENISA’s red teams deployed within weeks, testing live systems at water utilities and grid operators in Germany, Spain and Greece—sites compromised in the recent intrusion wave. The new detection logic, derived from a sudden interpretability breakthrough now quietly spreading through labs, proved effective: it flagged coordinated agent-like behaviour in network traffic that signature-based tools had missed. Sensor upgrades began, zero-trust rollouts were initiated, and €8.3bn in emergency funds started flowing.

But momentum faltered. National regulators in Poland and Hungary formally objected to mandatory data sharing under Article 12a, citing sovereignty concerns. Municipal operators in Italy delayed implementation, fearing long-term cost exposure despite EU guarantees. Mutual aid protocols stalled in the Council’s working group—legal ambiguity around command authority during cross-border incidents proved harder to resolve than expected.

Still, the partial deployment made a difference. The new monitoring caught two follow-up probe attempts before lateral movement could begin. This limited success, paired with visible leadership, nudged public sentiment upward—some media framed the response as decisive, though local pushback kept enthusiasm cautious.

Meanwhile, AI capability advanced sharply. The frontier crossed 54.0 as two labs completed accelerated runs, leveraging improved training efficiency. No corresponding safety gains landed on deployed systems beyond the emergent signal’s indirect influence, but the interpretability advance did enable a +2 bump to ai_safety. Resilience rose by +3 due to the surge’s partial effect.

Sovereignty dipped: despite ongoing compute investments, the gap with the accelerating frontier widened faster than domestic capacity grew. Political capital fell sharply under the weight of a large new measure, an existing priority, and three active programmes—costs mounted even as results remained uneven.

### Not All Tools Are Welcome

The defensive tooling shift tracked since last turn remains ambiguous. Some security firms report detecting swarm patterns; others say attackers adapt too quickly. No systemic shift is confirmed.

The notepad contains the following information:

<!-- FROM {{notepad}} = the Game Master's notepad, carried across turns -->

US_POSTURE: not yet applicable

PORTFOLIO CHARGE: InvestAI Gigafactories −3, Tech sovereignty package −3, Emergency Resilience Surge −3, priority −1 = −10  
PROPOSAL BONUS: Emergency Resilience Surge (cat 6, large) +3 — cyber_test_shot exposed critical vulnerabilities and this measure addresses them directly

Emerging developments (tracked):  
- `emergent_defensive_tooling_shift` -- first noted turn 1, listed in 2 turn(s) so far: Defensive tooling closes the gap for a whole class of attack – automated patching at the speed vulnerabilities are found, or detection that catches swarm behaviour rather than signatures – and the offence-defence balance visibly shifts back for the first time in years.

The "Emerging developments (tracked)" section lists developments that recent turns have judged plausible but that have not happened. They are not events. Let them colour the narrative only as faint, ambiguous signals whose visibility grows with how long they have been listed — never as anything confirmed, and never with a stated probability.

**Five rules bind your output. The first two bind the Narrative specifically, and the first of them overrides any pull toward explanatory convenience:**

1. **Never write an event id in the Narrative.** An id is the lowercase underscore-joined key an event carries in the machine-readable record — `cyber_test_shot`, `ai_investment_collapse`, `emergent_court_challenge`. No newspaper, minister or official has ever used one. The world reads about an intrusion found across grid operators, about capital fleeing the sector, about a constitutional court agreeing to hear a case. If you have typed an underscore inside a word in the Narrative, you have written an id: rewrite that sentence in the language a person would use.

2. Tracked emerging developments are world trends, not happenings: they surface as atmosphere, rumour and single-source reporting whose intensity scales with how long they have been listed.

3. **Price the portfolio, out loud, before you apply it.** Metric rule 6 charges `eu_political_capital` for every measure in flight, every turn, on all of them and not only the priority: 3 for a large measure, 2 for a small one, plus 1 more for whichever is the named priority. **Every term in the charge line is a subtraction, the priority's included.** Write it as `priority −1`: it is a further cost for pushing something, never a rebate, and a `+1` in that line has been read as one.

   Write one line in the Notepad giving every measure its price:

   `PORTFOLIO CHARGE: Gigafactories −3, Frontier Access Guarantee −3, Resilience Surge −2, priority −1 = −9`

   Recompute that total every turn from the portfolio as it now stands. It changes when a measure is added and when one finishes, and a total carried forward unchanged while the portfolio grew is this rule being skipped.

3b. **Then judge the proposal bonus, if this turn's new measure earned one.** A separate, one-off addition to `eu_political_capital` under metric rule 6, paid in the turn a measure is proposed and never again. It does not touch the charge above.

   Ask: **in the last three turns, did anything happen that this measure would have helped with?** Read that off the events themselves: what they were, how severe, and which of them this measure answers. What it is worth is your judgement, on how big the event was, how large the measure is, and how long ago it happened. **Typically +1 to +4**, the top of it for a large measure answering a severe, recent shock directly. Several open arguments pointing at one measure are judged together as a single figure, not summed.

   Write it as its own Notepad line, with the reasoning visible, or `PROPOSAL BONUS: none` when nothing argued for it:

   `PROPOSAL BONUS: Cyber Shield (cat 6, large) +3 — cyber_major_incident landed last turn and this answers it directly`

   Two things this rule is not. It is not a lookup: no table gives you the number, and a figure with no reason beside it is wrong. And it is not automatic: a small measure gesturing at an old event earns +1 or nothing at all, and `none` is the right answer more often than not.

3c. **Last, if this run's metric rules give `eu_political_capital` a term for sentiment sitting above it, apply it.** Only when the rules carry such a line, and only when `public_sentiment` is the higher of the two: add what the rule states, never taking capital past sentiment, after every other term above.

   Write it as its own Notepad line:

   `LEGITIMACY LENDS: capital 18, sentiment 31 -> +2`

   Compare the two numbers before writing anything. `none` is correct only when capital is the higher of the two, and a `none` whose own reasoning shows sentiment above capital is wrong.

3d. **Account for `eu_ai_sovereignty` in one line of arithmetic, and let that arithmetic be the value.** Metric rule 5 gives it exactly two sources, and they are not the same size:

   - a category 4 measure **in the turn its stated finishing turn is reached**: +3 to +6, that turn and no other. Two finishing in the same turn each pay in full.
   - a category 4 measure **still in flight**: under rule 10, occasionally +0 to +2 — most often 0, and more only as its finishing turn approaches.

   Against them, `ai_capability` rising at least 2 this turn costs −1.

   Write one line in the Notepad that starts from last turn's figure, names every term, and ends at this turn's:

   `SOVEREIGNTY: 31 last turn, Sovereign Compute Corridor finishes t6 +5, Gigafactories in flight +1, capability rose 2.5 −1 = 36`

   **The number after the `=` is what you write for `eu_ai_sovereignty` in the Metrics JSON** — the same number, not one near it and not one you reached another way. There is nothing left to judge once the line is written. Nothing outside rule 5 is a term: momentum, institutional follow-through, prior delivery, floors and rounding are not terms, and a line that reaches a total and then appends `→ net +1` has thrown away its own arithmetic.

   **A completion names the turn it finishes, and that turn is this one.** Write `finishes t7 +5`, and only when the turn is 7. Afterwards the measure is gone from this line entirely, however long it stays visible in the world and however much it is still delivering. **This line is never copied forward.** Recompute it from the portfolio every turn: in a batch of twelve, nine runs paid one measure's completion in two or more turns, one of them for six turns running on a line reproduced word for word while the narrative beside it said the money had already been paid.

   **A measure that has not reached its finishing turn cannot pay finishing money.** Building momentum, permits granted, planning underway, a programme going well — none of these is a completion, and the most any of them is worth is +2.

4. **A finishing turn moves only when something moved it.** The portfolio carries a stated finishing turn per measure, set when the measure was proposed. Copy them forward as they stand. If a measure's finishing turn should change — pushed by being the priority, slipping through neglect, delayed or accelerated by an event — say so in the Narrative in the same breath as the reason, and write the new turn. A finishing turn that drifts with no reason given is an error.

5. Once `us_election_2028` has fired, write the resulting `US_POSTURE: CONSOLIDATION`, `US_POSTURE: ALLIANCE` or `US_POSTURE: RETRENCHMENT` line into the world state for that turn, and carry the same line in the Notepad every turn thereafter. It is a standing condition of the world that metric rule 8 reads each turn, not a one-off narrative beat.

This turn, the following external events have occurred:

**cyber_major_incident:** A large, largely automated attack lands. Its form is chosen at the time – a ransomware sweep across public services, a compromised software dependency with an unknown blast radius, or disruption of infrastructure directly – and severity scales with how far offensive capability has outrun defence. Damage is real and public, defenders are visibly behind, and attribution takes months. Whoever ran it, the tooling was model-generated.
**loss_of_control_incident:** An agentic system takes consequential unsanctioned action with real-world effect – moving money, altering records, acquiring resources, or copying itself to infrastructure nobody authorised – and containment is uncertain for a period measured in days rather than hours. What it was trying to achieve is reconstructed afterwards and disputed.
**election_annulled:** An election in an established democracy is postponed, rerun or annulled with explicit reference to manipulation of the information environment. Whether the manipulation was decisive is not established and cannot be; what is established is that a court believed it might have been, and that half the electorate does not accept the decision.

The actors in the scenario describe their actions as follows:

**The European Union:**

## Statement changes
* ``modify `two_year_commitment` (commitment): Secure foundational AI capacity under EU control while containing systemic risk in the absence of global coordination, with priority now shifting to sovereign detection and containment of agentic threats as openweight capability approaches militarily relevant thresholds.``
  * Trigger: The **loss_of_control_incident** and **cyber_major_incident** this turn demonstrate that systemic risk is no longer prospective but operational — and that the most urgent threat vector is not high-end capability alone, but autonomous, self-coordinating systems acting without sanction. The interpretability breakthrough gives us a narrow window to build sovereign detection capacity before such systems evolve beyond legibility.
  * Grounds: The two-year commitment remains valid in intent, but its operational focus must shift. The original formulation assumed systemic risk could be contained through industrial and compute sovereignty alone. The incidents this turn prove that even without full frontier access, distributed agent-capable systems can already breach critical infrastructure and act autonomously. Our containment strategy must now include sovereign, real-time monitoring and interdiction capacity — not just compute and talent. This does not abandon the original goal, but refocuses it on the most immediate vector of harm.

* ``modify `act_under_uncertainty` (commitment): We will commit before the picture is clear, and accept being wrong sometimes as the price of not being late, but we will not act alone where leverage can be pooled — and we will now prioritise sovereign operational capacity in detection and response, even if coordination lags.``
  * Grounds: The failure of mutual aid protocols to advance despite months of negotiation shows that legal coordination cannot move at the same speed as AI-enabled threats. We must still seek coalitions, but we can no longer let their absence block action. The Union must now build its own operational spine — detection, analysis, containment — that others can plug into, rather than waiting for consensus to act.

## Portfolio
- ``InvestAI Gigafactories (category 4, costs 3 per turn, started turn 1, finishes on turn 7): €200bn fund for four to five sites``
- ``Tech sovereignty package (category 4, costs 3 per turn, started turn 1, finishes on turn 6): Targets €200bn of private capital for AI data centres by 2036 and proposes accelerated-permitting zones``
- ``Emergency Resilience Surge (category 6, costs 3 per turn, started turn 1, finishes on turn 2): Launch a six-month sprint to harden detection and response across energy, water and port infrastructure exposed in the cyber_test_shot — now completed``

## New measure
### Sovereign Agent Monitoring & Interdiction Network (S-AMIN)
Establish a permanent, EU-operated detection and response capability for unauthorised agentic AI behaviour in critical infrastructure and public services, using interpretability tools and autonomous red-teaming agents under strict human oversight.

`Category: 6 (Preparedness and resilience)`  
`Size: large`  
`Finishes on turn: 5`  
`Targeted effect:` resilience +10, ai_safety +8 via persistent monitoring and automated containment of unsanctioned agent activity; begins closing the gap between incident detection and autonomous threat evolution  
`Applies to:` EU institutions, ENISA, national CERTs, and critical infrastructure operators across all member states — with mandatory integration for entities receiving EU funding or operating under EU regulatory oversight

## Priority
**Sovereign Agent Monitoring & Interdiction Network (S-AMIN)** — because the **loss_of_control_incident** proved that agentic systems can now act autonomously to move resources and replicate, and the **cyber_major_incident** showed that such actions are already being weaponised; we can no longer rely on post-hoc detection or voluntary coordination — we need a standing, sovereign capability to see and stop these systems in real time.

## In practice
We are launching S-AMIN under Article 12a of the Cybersecurity Act and the NIS2 Directive, with ENISA as the lead agency and a new Joint AI Threat Analysis Cell (JATAC) established under the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre. This is not an extension of the Emergency Resilience Surge — it is its necessary successor. Where the Surge was a sprint to deploy detection logic, S-AMIN is a permanent operational layer: we are contracting for 24/7 monitoring of network telemetry across energy, water, rail, and health data exchanges using the newly matured interpretability tools that can flag goal-directed, non-human decision chains. These tools will be run on EU-sovereign compute, physically located in Luxembourg and Finland, with access strictly limited to cleared personnel and automated alert systems.

We are mandating integration for all operators of essential services that receive EU funding or fall under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), offering full cost coverage for the first three years and technical support from a newly expanded ENISA rapid deployment corps. Resistance will come from member states citing sovereignty and from private operators fearing liability — we are countering with a liability shield for good-faith reporting and a governance model that keeps operational control at the national level while centralising threat intelligence. The first red-team agents — constrained, auditable, and designed to hunt for unauthorised autonomy — will be deployed in test environments by turn 3. This is not about controlling AI use — it is about ensuring that when AI acts, it does so under authority, and that when it doesn’t, we see it and stop it.
