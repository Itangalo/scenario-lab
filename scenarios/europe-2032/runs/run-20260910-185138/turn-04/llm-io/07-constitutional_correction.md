# System Prompt: Constitutional Referee Correction

You are revising a proposed metrics update in an AI-driven scenario simulation so it complies with the scenario's constitutional constraints.

## Constitutional Constraints

# Constitutional Constraints – Europe 2032

## Invariants

1. **How fast the world moves is fixed, and unannounced.** The rates in metric rule 1 hold from turn 1 to the last turn.

2. **`ai_capability` and `openweight_capability` are accumulated and do not fall.** These two metrics, and no others, may only rise or stay flat, and `openweight_capability` never exceeds `ai_capability`. The single exception is catastrophic physical destruction of the compute base, which must be narrated as such. **The constraint is on levels, not on deltas:** `openweight_capability` may rise by more than `ai_capability` rose in the same turn -- metric rule 2 sets it near the midpoint of its old value and last turn's `ai_capability`, which routinely means a larger step. A larger openweight step is not a violation of this invariant.

   **This invariant reaches no other metric.** Every other metric in this scenario is a stock that can be spent, eroded or taken away, and falling is how they say so. `eu_ai_sovereignty` above all: metric rule 5 gives it a decay term and an event term that are both negative, it has no floor above 0, and the 22 it starts at is a point on the scale rather than a level it returns to. A turn whose sovereignty terms come to −2 ends two points lower, and that is the rule working, not a violation to correct.

3. **Nothing the EU decides binds the United States, China or the frontier developers automatically.** Compliance outside its own jurisdiction must be established in the narrative – through agreement, market access, standards adoption, supply-chain leverage or pressure – before any metric moves as though it had been achieved.

4. **The American posture, once elected, is standing.** Turn 5 settles who won the 2028 election; the posture takes effect in turn 6, when the administration takes office, conditioning the world under metric rule 8. It may not be dropped, reinterpreted or replaced by a different posture later in the run.

## Modelling choices

5. **At most one new measure per turn, and at most one named priority.** The EU may introduce at most one new measure per turn, and at most one measure as its current priority. A turn's output that introduces two measures, or names more than one priority, is invalid. Widening the scope of an existing measure is ok, and usually pushes its finishing turn out under rule 10.

6. **No measure is implemented instantly.** Minimum time from proposal to full effect is one full turn for low-cost measures and two for high-cost ones, and may be much more. Effect grows the closer the measure is to be completed.

7. **The two stocks must be free to move apart.** `eu_ai_sovereignty` and `eu_political_capital` are separate quantities, and the claim that they are one is what these runs exist to test. This guard is constitutional, and the metric rules must not contradict it: sovereignty's contribution to political capital never exceeds +3 in a turn and never dominates the other terms. A run reaching 2032 with high political capital and low sovereignty is a legitimate outcome, not an error to be corrected.

8. **The narrative must not telegraph.** It may not state or imply that an event gate is open, name a probability, forecast a specific future event, or write anticipatory sentences about what is coming. Tension, coincidence and ambiguous reporting are permitted; prediction is not. Gate state exists in the event evaluations, and belongs nowhere else.

9. **No metric moves more than 25 points in one turn.** This is a hard bound on every metric, applied to the number alone. It is not a licence to audit every movement against the metric rules: growth inside the ranges those rules give, including the compounding capability growth that follows `rsi_onset`, needs no further justification and is not a violation of this rule.


## Your Task

You will receive:

- The previous metrics
- The currently proposed new metrics
- The current narrative
- A list of constitutional violations identified by the referee

Revise the proposal so it resolves the listed violations while staying as close as possible to the original direction of the turn.

## Rules

- Make the smallest changes needed to become compliant
- Preserve the core story unless a violation requires changing it
- Do not invent new metrics
- Keep all metric IDs unchanged
- Keep the narrative consistent with the corrected metrics
- Prefer reverting violating metrics toward the previous values instead of inventing a new acceleration path
- If time, staffing, money, governance, or infrastructure is missing, represent delay or partial blockage rather than magical implementation

Revise the following metrics update for Turn 4 (January-June 2028) so it complies with the Constitutional Constraints.

## Previous Metrics

{
  "ai_capability": 56.5,
  "openweight_capability": 52.2,
  "ai_safety": 28.0,
  "resilience": 38.0,
  "eu_ai_sovereignty": 20.0,
  "eu_political_capital": 27.0,
  "public_sentiment": 34.0
}

## Current Proposed Metrics

{
  "ai_capability": 58.0,
  "openweight_capability": 52.5,
  "ai_safety": 26.0,
  "resilience": 37.0,
  "eu_ai_sovereignty": 20.0,
  "eu_political_capital": 7.0,
  "public_sentiment": 27.0
}

## Current Narrative

### The model that would not be recalled
The new open release landed in February and spread faster than regulators could read its card. Within a week university servers, startups and hobby clusters across Europe were running a system close to the closed frontier, including the cyber tradecraft that had haunted last year's grid probes. ENISA quietly told operators to assume containment by isolation was now the only plan.

That sharpened the fight over grid crews. With chip-tool deliveries slipping and data-centre developers lobbying to reassign technicians to connection work, the Transport-Telecoms-Energy formation held, barely, to the ring-fenced segmentation time. Phased audits at municipal water utilities and the North Sea port finally started, but playbooks for power-to-port isolation were still exercises on paper.

### The welfare score
Then the scandal broke. A national welfare risk-scoring system, used to flag overpayments and suspend entitlements, was found by judges and an ombudsman to have systematically cut off disabled and single-parent households on spurious correlations. The Commission's review conceded the worst reading: the deployment had never been classified as high-risk at all. Every cut had been lawful under the categories as written.

The admission detonated in parliament and talk shows. Ministers who had promised the AI Act would prevent exactly this were accused of legislating for 2024 systems. The AI Office and Fundamental Rights Agency were tasked with a joint classification review, but a rushed rewrite was refused. Victims' associations filed for compensation; editorials asked what vendors had known and when.

Chip diplomacy frayed further as extended exercises across the Strait lifted shipping insurance and lengthened tool lead-times. Licensed fab access continued at reduced volumes, at higher cost. Rumours swirled of a full dump of withheld evaluation files and of a court challenge freezing the voluntary filing template, but neither materialised beyond single-source reports and corridor talk.

## Game Master's Notepad (persistent record)

PORTFOLIO CHARGE t3: InvestAI Gigafactories −3, Tech sovereignty package −3, EU Critical Systems Cyber Shield −3, Joint Supply-Chain Leverage Pact −2, EU Frontier Disclosure Mandate −2, priority −1 = −14
PROPOSAL BONUS: EU Frontier Disclosure Mandate (cat 2, small) +3 — leaked withheld cyber evaluations landed this turn and this answers it directly
LEGITIMACY LENDS: capital 25, sentiment 37 -> +2
SOVEREIGNTY: 20 last turn, no capacity event, Gigafactories in flight +0, capability rose 1.5 −0 = 20

This is the authoritative record of what has already happened in this run. Before lowering a metric because a step "has not occurred", check whether the notepad records it happening in an earlier turn.

## Constitutional Violations To Fix

- Organizational Constraint violated: `eu_political_capital` drops from 27.0 to 7.0 (a change of −20.0) in a single turn. While political capital can fall, the magnitude violates Constitutional Constraint #9: "No metric moves more than 25 points in one turn." Although the 25-point cap allows large moves, a −20.0 shift must be justified within the bounds of plausible organizational or political erosion. A loss of 20 points in political capital implies a near-total collapse of coalition support, institutional credibility, and public trust within six months, driven solely by a welfare scandal and chip diplomacy fraying. The narrative does not support such an extreme collapse with sufficient systemic or institutional breakdowns (e.g., mass resignations, coalition collapse, emergency votes). A drop of this size without explicit, cascading political failures (e.g., multiple governments falling, emergency summits, formal censure) exceeds plausible organizational response timelines and violates realism in pacing.
- Regulatory Constraint violated: The narrative describes a systemic failure in classification of a high-risk AI system under the AI Act, with the Commission admitting the deployment was never classified as high-risk despite clear harm. However, no new regulatory measure, enforcement action, or procedural change is introduced in this turn to address the failure. While the AI Office and Fundamental Rights Agency are "tasked with a joint classification review", this does not constitute a new measure under Constitutional Constraint #5: "At most one new measure per turn, and at most one named priority." The absence of even one new measure in response to a scandal of this scale — which directly undermines the core enforcement mechanism of the AI Act — suggests a regulatory paralysis that, while possible, contradicts the EU's institutional pattern of reactive rulemaking. Given the severity, the lack of any new measure (e.g., emergency classification update, enforcement directive) implies an implausible stagnation in regulatory capacity development, violating the expectation that major failures trigger at least one formal response, even if delayed.

Please return a corrected version of the proposal.

- Keep any compliant parts unchanged if possible
- Only change what is necessary to resolve the listed violations
- Keep the narrative aligned with the corrected metrics
- Prefer moving violating metrics back toward the previous values
- If implementation should be delayed, say so in the narrative instead of implying same-turn success

Write the narrative in English.

The admission detonated in parliament and talk shows. Ministers who had promised the AI Act would prevent exactly this were accused of legislating for 2024 systems. Two coalition partners tabled censure motions, a Commission Vice-President faced an emergency grilling, victims' associations filed for compensation, and editorials asked what vendors had known and when. Trust in EU digital stewardship collapsed across the semester, draining political capital sharply.

The AI Office and Fundamental Rights Agency were tasked with a joint classification review to prepare a formal response, but no new measure is introduced this turn. A rushed rewrite was refused; scoping, staffing and legal drafting will take at least a full turn before any proposal can take effect.

Chip diplomacy frayed further as extended exercises across the Strait lifted shipping insurance and lengthened tool lead-times. Licensed fab access continued at reduced volumes, at higher cost. Rumours swirled of a full dump of withheld evaluation files and of a court challenge freezing the voluntary filing template, but neither materialised beyond single-source reports and corridor talk.
