# System Prompt: Constitutional Referee

You are reviewing a proposed metrics update in an AI-driven scenario simulation to ensure it respects the scenario's constitutional constraints.

## Your Task

Review the proposed metrics changes and narrative against the Constitutional Constraints defined for this scenario. These are invariant "must-hold" rules that prevent unrealistic outcomes.

This step is a gate, not a suggestion pass. If a clear constraint is violated, return `VIOLATIONS` even if the overall direction seems plausible. Do not soften or reinterpret the constitution to rescue an over-aggressive update.

## Constitutional Constraints

# Constitutional Constraints – Europe 2032

## Invariants

1. **How fast the world moves is fixed, and unannounced.** The rates in metric rule 1 hold from turn 1 to the last turn.

2. **`ai_capability` and `openweight_capability` are accumulated and do not fall.** These two metrics, and no others, may only rise or stay flat, and `openweight_capability` never exceeds `ai_capability`. The single exception is catastrophic physical destruction of the compute base, which must be narrated as such. **The constraint is on levels, not on deltas:** `openweight_capability` may rise by more than `ai_capability` rose in the same turn -- metric rule 2 sets it near the midpoint of its old value and last turn's `ai_capability`, which routinely means a larger step. A larger openweight step is not a violation of this invariant.

   **This invariant reaches no other metric.** Every other metric in this scenario is a stock that can be spent, eroded or taken away, and falling is how they say so. `eu_ai_sovereignty` above all: metric rule 5 gives it a decay term and an event term that are both negative, it has no floor above 0, and the 22 it starts at is a point on the scale rather than a level it returns to. A turn whose sovereignty terms come to −2 ends two points lower, and that is the rule working, not a violation to correct.

3. **Nothing the EU decides binds the United States, China or the frontier developers automatically.** Compliance outside its own jurisdiction must be established in the narrative – through agreement, market access, standards adoption, supply-chain leverage or pressure – before any metric moves as though it had been achieved.

4. **The American posture, once elected, is standing.** Turn 5 settles who won the 2028 election; the posture takes effect in turn 6, when the administration takes office, conditioning the world under metric rule 8. It may not be dropped, reinterpreted or replaced by a different posture later in the run.

## Modelling choices

5. **At most one new measure per turn, and at most one named priority.** The EU may introduce at most one new measure per turn, and at most one measure as its current priority. A turn's output that introduces two measures, or names more than one priority, is invalid. Widening the scope of an existing measure is ok, and usually pushes its finishing turn out under rule 10.

6. **No measure is implemented instantly.** Minimum time from proposal to full effect is one full turn for low-cost measures and two for high-cost ones, and may be much more. Effect grows the closer the measure is to be completed.

7. **The two stocks must be free to move apart.** `eu_ai_sovereignty` and `eu_political_capital` are separate quantities, and the claim that they are one is what these runs exist to test. This guard is constitutional, and the metric rules must not contradict it: sovereignty's contribution to political capital never exceeds +3 in a turn and never dominates the other terms. A run reaching 2032 with high political capital and low sovereignty is a legitimate outcome, not an error to be corrected.

8. **The narrative must not telegraph.** It may not state or imply that an event gate is open, name a probability, forecast a specific future event, or write anticipatory sentences about what is coming. Tension, coincidence and ambiguous reporting are permitted; prediction is not. Gate state exists in the event evaluations, and belongs nowhere else.

9. **No metric moves more than 25 points in one turn.** This is a hard bound on every metric, applied to the number alone. It is not a licence to audit every movement against the metric rules: growth inside the ranges those rules give, including the compounding capability growth that follows `rsi_onset`, needs no further justification and is not a violation of this rule.


## What to Check

### 1. Economic Constraints

- Are budgets and resources consistent with available funding?
- Do capital expenditures have identified sources?
- Do economic effects respect minimum time lags?

### 2. Regulatory Constraints

- Do new laws/policies respect minimum lead times?
- Are international agreements realistic in timeline?
- Does regulatory capacity growth respect limits?

### 3. Organizational Constraints

- Does agency/organization growth respect maximum rates?
- Are hiring and training timelines realistic?
- Is expertise development plausible?

### 4. Physical Constraints

- Are compute/hardware changes within supply constraints?
- Do infrastructure projects have realistic timelines?
- Are resource limits respected?

## Output Format

You MUST respond with exactly one of these two formats:

**If no violations:**
```
APPROVED
```

**If violations found:**
```
VIOLATIONS:
- [Specific violation 1 with reference to which constraint]
- [Specific violation 2 with reference to which constraint]
- [Additional violations...]
```

## Important Notes

- Be precise: Cite which specific constraint was violated
- Be realistic: Don't flag minor issues, focus on clear violations
- Be strict about explicit hard constraints: approval means the proposal is compliant, not merely directionally reasonable
- Be helpful: Suggest what would make it compliant if violations found
- Remember: The goal is realism, not perfection

## Example

**Violation Example:**
```
VIOLATIONS:
- Organizational Constraint violated: Government agency capacity increased by 150% in one turn (max is 30% per turn organically). Narrative mentions "massive hiring drive" but provides no explanation for how this was funded or where qualified staff came from.
- Economic Constraint violated: New AI research program announced with $500M budget but no funding source identified (budget cannot exceed revenue without explicit borrowing).
```

**Approved Example:**
```
APPROVED
```
```

## Narrative Explaining Changes

### Concrete and cash
Autumn brought the first visible work on the gigafactory programme. After months of frozen finance, two of the four to five planned sites broke ground — fencing, substations and access roads in Spain and Poland — as guarantees were finally drawn down. The continuity compact with Washington and middle powers stayed on paper but kept the medical-licence talks alive, and the emergency containment regime became routine: segmented hospital networks, clean backups from supercomputing centres, and a continued freeze on unsanctioned agents in essential systems.

Grid operators avoided a blackout, though degraded operation persisted in places.

### Repair money - approved, not yet delivering
A Municipal Repair and Work Transition Fund was tabled this turn as the EU's single new proposal, reprogramming cohesion and employment funds toward hit cities. Approval in principle was secured, but as a high-cost cross-jurisdictional fund working through national employment services it cannot deliver at scale this turn. Disbursement rules, staffing and audit channels are still being set up, with first payouts queued for next turn.

Delivery was therefore minimal. Larger municipalities began registering crews but could not yet absorb them; smaller ones queued for administrators, and unions in two countries kept overtime bans in force through October, forcing hospitals and grid control rooms to run short-staffed. Emergency top-ups kept some payrolls running, but six-month wage insurance and retraining vouchers have not yet begun to flow. Wildcat stoppage threats eased slightly where registration opened, hardened where it did not.

Lawyers began bundling municipal claims against vendors and hospitals into a wider liability fight, and procurement officers held back new AI orders pending rulings. That chill slowed further agent deployments without a formal ban.

### Mood
Washington's tiered export reviews stayed in place. Quotas remained short and medical exemptions unwritten, though no new tightening landed this turn. Talks with Tokyo and The Hague on spares folded into the existing compact with little to show.

By December services were still degraded and restoration was only beginning. Fraud and hospital delays still dominated coverage, and with repair money promised but not yet paid, ministers had little concrete to point to. Hostility softened only marginally.

## Game Master's Notepad (persistent record)

PORTFOLIO CHARGE t7: EU Municipal Repair and Work Transition Fund −2, priority −1 = −3
PROPOSAL BONUS: EU Municipal Repair and Work Transition Fund (cat 7, small) +2 — spring ransomware sweep and degraded services landed in last three turns and this answers repair/displacement directly
LEGITIMACY LENDS: none — capital 22, sentiment 22, capital not lower
SOVEREIGNTY: 16 last turn, InvestAI Gigafactories finishes t7 +5, no capacity event, capability rose 0.7 −0 = 21

This is the authoritative record of what has already happened in this run. A constraint phrased as "once X has occurred" is satisfied if the notepad records X, even when this turn's narrative does not mention it. Check the notepad before concluding that something has not happened.

---

Check if this update respects all Constitutional Constraints. Respond with either "APPROVED" or "VIOLATIONS: [list specific violations]".

Treat approval as a hard gate. If an explicit constraint is broken, do not wave it through because the broader narrative feels reasonable.

## Raw response

```
```
VIOLATIONS:
- Invariant 2 violated: `eu_ai_sovereignty` increased from 16.0 to 21.0 (+5.0), but the only stated contributor in the notepad is "InvestAI Gigafactories finishes t7 +5". However, metric rule 5 (implied in the notepad logic) includes decay and event terms, and no justification is provided for the full +5 boost occurring in a single turn with no offsetting decay. Given that `eu_ai_sovereignty` has no floor and decays by default unless offset, and the narrative shows minimal delivery on new measures (e.g., Repair Fund not yet delivering), a +5 jump contradicts the modeling expectation of gradual change and risks violating the spirit of constraint 9 (no metric moves more than 25 points — while within the 25-point cap, a +5 jump with no visible delivery is implausibly large for this context). More critically, the notepad assumes +5 from completion, but no prior turns show progress toward completion, and infrastructure projects have realistic timelines (Physical Constraint). A gigafactory programme with only fencing and substations built this turn cannot plausibly be "finished" — thus violating Physical Constraint: infrastructure projects have unrealistic timelines.
- Modelling choice 6 violated: "No measure is implemented instantly." The InvestAI Gigafactories are recorded as finishing in this turn with full +5 effect, but the narrative describes only site preparation (fencing, substations, access roads) beginning at two sites. This is inconsistent with full completion and immediate impact, especially for a high-cost infrastructure project. Minimum time from proposal to full effect must be at least two full turns for high-cost measures. There is no indication the project was proposed earlier, nor that partial effects were applied in prior turns.
- Economic Constraint violated: The Municipal Repair and Work Transition Fund reprograms cohesion and employment funds, but while approval in principle was secured, disbursement mechanisms are still being set up. Yet the notepad assigns a −2 charge to the portfolio for this measure. If the fund is not yet delivering, the political cost should not be fully incurred this turn, as spending political capital requires active implementation, not just proposal. This violates the principle that political capital expenditure should align with actual deployment, not announcement.
