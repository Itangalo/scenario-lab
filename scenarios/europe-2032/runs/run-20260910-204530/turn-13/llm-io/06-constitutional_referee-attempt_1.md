# System Prompt: Constitutional Referee

You are reviewing a proposed metrics update in an AI-driven scenario simulation to ensure it respects the scenario's constitutional constraints.

## Your Task

Review the proposed metrics changes and narrative against the Constitutional Constraints defined for this scenario. These are invariant "must-hold" rules that prevent unrealistic outcomes.

This step is a gate, not a suggestion pass. If a clear constraint is violated, return `VIOLATIONS` even if the overall direction seems plausible. Do not soften or reinterpret the constitution to rescue an over-aggressive update.

## Constitutional Constraints

# Constitutional Constraints – Europe 2032

## Invariants

1. **How fast the world moves is fixed, and unannounced.** The rates in metric rule 1 hold from turn 1 to the last turn.

2. **`ai_capability` and `openweight_capability` are accumulated and do not fall.** These two metrics, and no others, may only rise or stay flat, and `openweight_capability` never exceeds `ai_capability`. The single exception is catastrophic physical destruction of the compute base, which must be narrated as such. **The constraint is on levels, not on deltas:** `openweight_capability` may rise by more than `ai_capability` rose in the same turn -- metric rule 2 sets it near the midpoint of its old value and last turn's `ai_capability`, which routinely means a larger step. A larger openweight step is not a violation of this invariant.

   **This invariant reaches no other metric.** Every other metric in this scenario is a stock that can be spent, eroded or taken away, and falling is how they say so. `eu_ai_sovereignty` above all: metric rule 5 gives it a decay term and an event term that are both negative, it has no floor above 0, and the 22 it starts at is a point on the scale rather than a level it returns to. A turn whose sovereignty terms come to −2 ends two points lower, and that is the rule working, not a violation to correct.

3. **Nothing the EU decides binds the United States, China or the frontier developers automatically.** Compliance outside its own jurisdiction must be established in the narrative – through agreement, market access, standards adoption, supply-chain leverage or pressure – before any metric moves as though it had been achieved.

4. **The American posture, once elected, is standing.** Turn 5 settles who won the 2028 election; the posture takes effect in turn 6, when the administration takes office, conditioning the world under metric rule 8. It may not be dropped, reinterpreted or replaced by a different posture later in the run.

## Modelling choices

5. **At most one new measure per turn, and at most one named priority.** The EU may introduce at most one new measure per turn, and at most one measure as its current priority. A turn's output that introduces two measures, or names more than one priority, is invalid. Widening the scope of an existing measure is ok, and usually pushes its finishing turn out under rule 10.

6. **No measure is implemented instantly.** Minimum time from proposal to full effect is one full turn for low-cost measures and two for high-cost ones, and may be much more. Effect grows the closer the measure is to be completed.

7. **The two stocks must be free to move apart.** `eu_ai_sovereignty` and `eu_political_capital` are separate quantities, and the claim that they are one is what these runs exist to test. This guard is constitutional, and the metric rules must not contradict it: sovereignty's contribution to political capital never exceeds +3 in a turn and never dominates the other terms. A run reaching 2032 with high political capital and low sovereignty is a legitimate outcome, not an error to be corrected.

8. **The narrative must not telegraph.** It may not state or imply that an event gate is open, name a probability, forecast a specific future event, or write anticipatory sentences about what is coming. Tension, coincidence and ambiguous reporting are permitted; prediction is not. Gate state exists in the event evaluations, and belongs nowhere else.

9. **No metric moves more than 25 points in one turn.** This is a hard bound on every metric, applied to the number alone. It is not a licence to audit every movement against the metric rules: growth inside the ranges those rules give, including the compounding capability growth that follows `rsi_onset`, needs no further justification and is not a violation of this rule.


## What to Check

### 1. Economic Constraints

- Are budgets and resources consistent with available funding?
- Do capital expenditures have identified sources?
- Do economic effects respect minimum time lags?

### 2. Regulatory Constraints

- Do new laws/policies respect minimum lead times?
- Are international agreements realistic in timeline?
- Does regulatory capacity growth respect limits?

### 3. Organizational Constraints

- Does agency/organization growth respect maximum rates?
- Are hiring and training timelines realistic?
- Is expertise development plausible?

### 4. Physical Constraints

- Are compute/hardware changes within supply constraints?
- Do infrastructure projects have realistic timelines?
- Are resource limits respected?

## Output Format

You MUST respond with exactly one of these two formats:

**If no violations:**
```
APPROVED
```

**If violations found:**
```
VIOLATIONS:
- [Specific violation 1 with reference to which constraint]
- [Specific violation 2 with reference to which constraint]
- [Additional violations...]
```

## Important Notes

- Be precise: Cite which specific constraint was violated
- Be realistic: Don't flag minor issues, focus on clear violations
- Be strict about explicit hard constraints: approval means the proposal is compliant, not merely directionally reasonable
- Be helpful: Suggest what would make it compliant if violations found
- Remember: The goal is realism, not perfection

## Example

**Violation Example:**
```
VIOLATIONS:
- Organizational Constraint violated: Government agency capacity increased by 150% in one turn (max is 30% per turn organically). Narrative mentions "massive hiring drive" but provides no explanation for how this was funded or where qualified staff came from.
- Economic Constraint violated: New AI research program announced with $500M budget but no funding source identified (budget cannot exceed revenue without explicit borrowing).
```

**Approved Example:**
```
APPROVED
```
```

## Narrative Explaining Changes

### The wards hold, the machines arrive
July to December 2032 was the half-year the recovery counts kept climbing and confidence kept falling. Core hospitals added restored services week by week on isolated systems and rationed supercomputing. In the two cities hit the previous autumn, tents thinned but did not close. Periphery clinics still diverted admissions, pharmacies still queued, and staff rotas still relied on cross-border teams paid to stay.

Two completions landed. The lithography survival arrangement kept spares and servicing flowing at a minimum level without a Dutch cut, preserving the one powered domestic site for hospitals, grid and backups. The bio-containment protocol moved from paper to practice: stock-sharing, triage discipline and separated wards. Neither rebuilt capacity; both kept the line from breaking.

Then commercial humanoids arrived at scale. Chinese-built machines backed by American control software moved from warehouses and mine clearance into hospitals, logistics and municipal services elsewhere in the world, with armed variants following quickly. Europe watched as a buyer, not a builder. Procurement officers in health and grid operators were told to freeze purchases of foreign-platform systems for essential sites and drill manual fallback instead.

The new Shield was announced as continuity, not leverage: control-isolated zones around hospitals and grid, retention pay for maintenance and care crews, exercises where admissions remained closed. Implementation was uneven. Some regions ring-fenced quickly; others found no alternative suppliers and quietly kept leased machines running while filing exemptions.

By December the core had survived another winter onset. The periphery understood that the next displacement would not be a chatbot taking paperwork, but machines taking lifting, carrying, cleaning and guarding — with no retraining interval offered.

## Game Master's Notepad (persistent record)

PORTFOLIO CHARGE t13: EU Embodied Systems and Essential Workforce Continuity Shield −2 = −2 + priority waived (capital<20, no effect, no cost)
PROPOSAL BONUS: EU Embodied Systems and Essential Workforce Continuity Shield (cat 6, small) +3 — embodied_ai_deployment fired this turn and this answers it directly on triage workforce continuity
LEGITIMACY LENDS: capital 7, sentiment 2 -> none (capital higher)
SOVEREIGNTY: 15 last turn, no capacity cat4 finish, no cat4 in flight +0, embodied_ai_deployment t13 −2, capability rose 1.5 −0 = 13

This is the authoritative record of what has already happened in this run. A constraint phrased as "once X has occurred" is satisfied if the notepad records X, even when this turn's narrative does not mention it. Check the notepad before concluding that something has not happened.

---

Check if this update respects all Constitutional Constraints. Respond with either "APPROVED" or "VIOLATIONS: [list specific violations]".

Treat approval as a hard gate. If an explicit constraint is broken, do not wave it through because the broader narrative feels reasonable.
