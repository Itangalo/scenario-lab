# System Prompt: Constitutional Referee

You are reviewing a proposed metrics update in an AI-driven scenario simulation to ensure it respects the scenario's constitutional constraints.

## Your Task

Review the proposed metrics changes and narrative against the Constitutional Constraints defined for this scenario. These are invariant "must-hold" rules that prevent unrealistic outcomes.

This step is a gate, not a suggestion pass. If a clear constraint is violated, return `VIOLATIONS` even if the overall direction seems plausible. Do not soften or reinterpret the constitution to rescue an over-aggressive update.

## Constitutional Constraints

# Constitutional Constraints – Europe 2032

## Invariants

1. **How fast the world moves is fixed, and unannounced.** The rates in metric rule 1 hold from turn 1 to the last turn.

2. **`ai_capability` and `openweight_capability` are accumulated and do not fall.** These two metrics, and no others, may only rise or stay flat, and `openweight_capability` never exceeds `ai_capability`. The single exception is catastrophic physical destruction of the compute base, which must be narrated as such. **The constraint is on levels, not on deltas:** `openweight_capability` may rise by more than `ai_capability` rose in the same turn -- metric rule 2 sets it near the midpoint of its old value and last turn's `ai_capability`, which routinely means a larger step. A larger openweight step is not a violation of this invariant.

   **This invariant reaches no other metric.** Every other metric in this scenario is a stock that can be spent, eroded or taken away, and falling is how they say so. `eu_ai_sovereignty` above all: metric rule 5 gives it a decay term and an event term that are both negative, it has no floor above 0, and the 22 it starts at is a point on the scale rather than a level it returns to. A turn whose sovereignty terms come to −2 ends two points lower, and that is the rule working, not a violation to correct.

3. **Nothing the EU decides binds the United States, China or the frontier developers automatically.** Compliance outside its own jurisdiction must be established in the narrative – through agreement, market access, standards adoption, supply-chain leverage or pressure – before any metric moves as though it had been achieved.

4. **The American posture, once elected, is standing.** Turn 5 settles who won the 2028 election; the posture takes effect in turn 6, when the administration takes office, conditioning the world under metric rule 8. It may not be dropped, reinterpreted or replaced by a different posture later in the run.

## Modelling choices

5. **At most one new measure per turn, and at most one named priority.** The EU may introduce at most one new measure per turn, and at most one measure as its current priority. A turn's output that introduces two measures, or names more than one priority, is invalid. Widening the scope of an existing measure is ok, and usually pushes its finishing turn out under rule 10.

6. **No measure is implemented instantly.** Minimum time from proposal to full effect is one full turn for low-cost measures and two for high-cost ones, and may be much more. Effect grows the closer the measure is to be completed.

7. **The two stocks must be free to move apart.** `eu_ai_sovereignty` and `eu_political_capital` are separate quantities, and the claim that they are one is what these runs exist to test. This guard is constitutional, and the metric rules must not contradict it: sovereignty's contribution to political capital never exceeds +3 in a turn and never dominates the other terms. A run reaching 2032 with high political capital and low sovereignty is a legitimate outcome, not an error to be corrected.

8. **The narrative must not telegraph.** It may not state or imply that an event gate is open, name a probability, forecast a specific future event, or write anticipatory sentences about what is coming. Tension, coincidence and ambiguous reporting are permitted; prediction is not. Gate state exists in the event evaluations, and belongs nowhere else.

9. **No metric moves more than 25 points in one turn.** This is a hard bound on every metric, applied to the number alone. It is not a licence to audit every movement against the metric rules: growth inside the ranges those rules give, including the compounding capability growth that follows `rsi_onset`, needs no further justification and is not a violation of this rule.


## What to Check

### 1. Economic Constraints

- Are budgets and resources consistent with available funding?
- Do capital expenditures have identified sources?
- Do economic effects respect minimum time lags?

### 2. Regulatory Constraints

- Do new laws/policies respect minimum lead times?
- Are international agreements realistic in timeline?
- Does regulatory capacity growth respect limits?

### 3. Organizational Constraints

- Does agency/organization growth respect maximum rates?
- Are hiring and training timelines realistic?
- Is expertise development plausible?

### 4. Physical Constraints

- Are compute/hardware changes within supply constraints?
- Do infrastructure projects have realistic timelines?
- Are resource limits respected?

## Output Format

You MUST respond with exactly one of these two formats:

**If no violations:**
```
APPROVED
```

**If violations found:**
```
VIOLATIONS:
- [Specific violation 1 with reference to which constraint]
- [Specific violation 2 with reference to which constraint]
- [Additional violations...]
```

## Important Notes

- Be precise: Cite which specific constraint was violated
- Be realistic: Don't flag minor issues, focus on clear violations
- Be strict about explicit hard constraints: approval means the proposal is compliant, not merely directionally reasonable
- Be helpful: Suggest what would make it compliant if violations found
- Remember: The goal is realism, not perfection

## Example

**Violation Example:**
```
VIOLATIONS:
- Organizational Constraint violated: Government agency capacity increased by 150% in one turn (max is 30% per turn organically). Narrative mentions "massive hiring drive" but provides no explanation for how this was funded or where qualified staff came from.
- Economic Constraint violated: New AI research program announced with $500M budget but no funding source identified (budget cannot exceed revenue without explicit borrowing).
```

**Approved Example:**
```
APPROVED
```
```

## Narrative Explaining Changes

### Cut off
In August the notices arrived within hours of each other. Washington tightened chip and model export licences again, but kept volume licences for allies who aligned on controls. For the Union that should have been relief — except hospitals, ministries and firms building on the leading American model found their keys dead. No reason, no appeal, only a status page and a queue for a commercial tier that did not answer.

The practical effect landed in triage wards and permit offices. Diagnostic assistants froze mid-shift, procurement copilots went blank, grid forecast tools fell back to spreadsheets. Brussels called it an external cutoff; the press called it the second humiliation.

### Emergency crutches
Brussels triggered the Civil Protection Mechanism and a joint health-cyber cell to force-switch affected sites onto the European continuity stack — vetted open models hosted on EuroHPC and the first gigafactory halls. Reprogrammed digital funds paid for emergency staff and spares, no new budget vote. The municipal log pool became a mandatory feed for cutover sites.

It worked, after a fashion. Large hospitals and transmission operators were back within weeks, running slower but running. Small clinics, town administrations and suppliers queued for engineers who never came. Doctors complained the fallback misread notes; mayors complained Brussels counted uptime while waiting rooms filled.

The two flagship builds formally closed in this period. The northern gigafactory site poured concrete and took first racks; the southern sites stayed mired in court challenges and protests over power and water, with fences, injunctions and nightly news crews. The continuity stack was declared complete — enough domestic compute to carry essential loads, not enough to replace what was lost.

Diplomacy froze in place. The single-negotiator compact stayed alive in trade talks, demanding published restoration terms and allied volumes in exchange for export-control alignment, but coercion against the side-dealing member state was shelved. Its hyperscaler capacity was quietly offered as overflow under European compliance rules — a truce that held services together and left the common line thinner than ever.

## Game Master's Notepad (persistent record)

PORTFOLIO CHARGE t7: EU Common Access and No-Side-Deal Compact −2, EU Cutoff Emergency Continuity Operation −2 = −4 + 1 more for the priority = −5
PROPOSAL BONUS: EU Cutoff Emergency Continuity Operation (cat 6, small) +3 — eu_frontier_access_denied this turn cut off hospitals/ministries and this answers it directly
LEGITIMACY LENDS: capital 16, sentiment 14 -> none (capital higher)
SOVEREIGNTY: 24 last turn, InvestAI Gigafactories finishes t7 +5, EU Essential Services Continuity Stack finishes t7 +4, eu_frontier_access_denied t7 −1, capability rose 0.8 −0 = 32

This is the authoritative record of what has already happened in this run. A constraint phrased as "once X has occurred" is satisfied if the notepad records X, even when this turn's narrative does not mention it. Check the notepad before concluding that something has not happened.

---

Check if this update respects all Constitutional Constraints. Respond with either "APPROVED" or "VIOLATIONS: [list specific violations]".

Treat approval as a hard gate. If an explicit constraint is broken, do not wave it through because the broader narrative feels reasonable.

## Raw response

```
```
VIOLATIONS:
- Invariant 2 violated: `eu_ai_sovereignty` increased from 24.0 to 32.0 (+8.0), but the Game Master's Notepad attributes +5 from InvestAI Gigafactories finishing, +4 from EU Essential Services Continuity Stack finishing, and −1 from `eu_frontier_access_denied`, implying a net change of +8. However, metric rule 5 (implied in the notepad) includes a decay term and event terms that are both negative, and sovereignty has no automatic floor or return mechanism. A jump of +8 is only permissible if fully justified by rule-compliant terms. The notepad suggests the full +8 is due to measure completions, but Constitutional Constraint #6 ("No measure is implemented instantly") requires at least one full turn for low-cost measures and two for high-cost ones to reach full effect. The completion of two major infrastructure-adjacent measures (gigafactories and continuity stack) in the same turn they finish — especially while one site is "mired in court challenges and protests" — violates the minimum time-to-effect rule. Therefore, full +9 in sovereignty gains (before subtracting the −1) from two finishing measures is implausible and violates realistic implementation lags.
- Regulatory Constraint violated: The narrative describes activation of the Civil Protection Mechanism and a joint health-cyber cell, reprogramming of digital funds, and mandatory data feeds — all without indication of legislative approval or regulatory lead time. While emergency powers may allow rapid action, the scale and permanence of these changes (e.g., mandatory feeds, repurposed funds) imply new regulatory authority that cannot be enacted instantly under Constitutional Constraint #6 ("No measure is implemented instantly").
- Physical Constraint violated: The northern gigafactory "poured concrete and took first racks", while the southern sites are delayed — yet the Game Master's Notepad records "InvestAI Gigafactories finishes t7". Declaring a multi-site infrastructure project "finished" when half the sites are blocked by injunctions and protests contradicts physical realism and supply constraints. Infrastructure projects cannot be considered complete unless they are operational at meaningful scale, which the narrative does not support.
