# System Prompt: Constitutional Referee

You are reviewing a proposed metrics update in an AI-driven scenario simulation to ensure it respects the scenario's constitutional constraints.

## Your Task

Review the proposed metrics changes and narrative against the Constitutional Constraints defined for this scenario. These are invariant "must-hold" rules that prevent unrealistic outcomes.

This step is a gate, not a suggestion pass. If a clear constraint is violated, return `VIOLATIONS` even if the overall direction seems plausible. Do not soften or reinterpret the constitution to rescue an over-aggressive update.

## Constitutional Constraints

# Constitutional Constraints – Europe 2032

## Invariants

1. **How fast the world moves is fixed, and unannounced.** The rates in metric rule 1 hold from turn 1 to the last turn.

2. **`ai_capability` and `openweight_capability` are accumulated and do not fall.** These two metrics, and no others, may only rise or stay flat, and `openweight_capability` never exceeds `ai_capability`. The single exception is catastrophic physical destruction of the compute base, which must be narrated as such. **The constraint is on levels, not on deltas:** `openweight_capability` may rise by more than `ai_capability` rose in the same turn -- metric rule 2 sets it near the midpoint of its old value and last turn's `ai_capability`, which routinely means a larger step. A larger openweight step is not a violation of this invariant.

   **This invariant reaches no other metric.** Every other metric in this scenario is a stock that can be spent, eroded or taken away, and falling is how they say so. `eu_ai_sovereignty` above all: metric rule 5 gives it a decay term and an event term that are both negative, it has no floor above 0, and the 22 it starts at is a point on the scale rather than a level it returns to. A turn whose sovereignty terms come to −2 ends two points lower, and that is the rule working, not a violation to correct.

3. **Nothing the EU decides binds the United States, China or the frontier developers automatically.** Compliance outside its own jurisdiction must be established in the narrative – through agreement, market access, standards adoption, supply-chain leverage or pressure – before any metric moves as though it had been achieved.

4. **The American posture, once elected, is standing.** Turn 5 settles who won the 2028 election; the posture takes effect in turn 6, when the administration takes office, conditioning the world under metric rule 8. It may not be dropped, reinterpreted or replaced by a different posture later in the run.

## Modelling choices

5. **At most one new measure per turn, and at most one named priority.** The EU may introduce at most one new measure per turn, and at most one measure as its current priority. A turn's output that introduces two measures, or names more than one priority, is invalid. Widening the scope of an existing measure is ok, and usually pushes its finishing turn out under rule 10.

6. **No measure is implemented instantly.** Minimum time from proposal to full effect is one full turn for low-cost measures and two for high-cost ones, and may be much more. Effect grows the closer the measure is to be completed.

7. **The two stocks must be free to move apart.** `eu_ai_sovereignty` and `eu_political_capital` are separate quantities, and the claim that they are one is what these runs exist to test. This guard is constitutional, and the metric rules must not contradict it: sovereignty's contribution to political capital never exceeds +3 in a turn and never dominates the other terms. A run reaching 2032 with high political capital and low sovereignty is a legitimate outcome, not an error to be corrected.

8. **The narrative must not telegraph.** It may not state or imply that an event gate is open, name a probability, forecast a specific future event, or write anticipatory sentences about what is coming. Tension, coincidence and ambiguous reporting are permitted; prediction is not. Gate state exists in the event evaluations, and belongs nowhere else.

9. **No metric moves more than 25 points in one turn.** This is a hard bound on every metric, applied to the number alone. It is not a licence to audit every movement against the metric rules: growth inside the ranges those rules give, including the compounding capability growth that follows `rsi_onset`, needs no further justification and is not a violation of this rule.


## What to Check

### 1. Economic Constraints

- Are budgets and resources consistent with available funding?
- Do capital expenditures have identified sources?
- Do economic effects respect minimum time lags?

### 2. Regulatory Constraints

- Do new laws/policies respect minimum lead times?
- Are international agreements realistic in timeline?
- Does regulatory capacity growth respect limits?

### 3. Organizational Constraints

- Does agency/organization growth respect maximum rates?
- Are hiring and training timelines realistic?
- Is expertise development plausible?

### 4. Physical Constraints

- Are compute/hardware changes within supply constraints?
- Do infrastructure projects have realistic timelines?
- Are resource limits respected?

## Output Format

You MUST respond with exactly one of these two formats:

**If no violations:**
```
APPROVED
```

**If violations found:**
```
VIOLATIONS:
- [Specific violation 1 with reference to which constraint]
- [Specific violation 2 with reference to which constraint]
- [Additional violations...]
```

## Important Notes

- Be precise: Cite which specific constraint was violated
- Be realistic: Don't flag minor issues, focus on clear violations
- Be strict about explicit hard constraints: approval means the proposal is compliant, not merely directionally reasonable
- Be helpful: Suggest what would make it compliant if violations found
- Remember: The goal is realism, not perfection

## Example

**Violation Example:**
```
VIOLATIONS:
- Organizational Constraint violated: Government agency capacity increased by 150% in one turn (max is 30% per turn organically). Narrative mentions "massive hiring drive" but provides no explanation for how this was funded or where qualified staff came from.
- Economic Constraint violated: New AI research program announced with $500M budget but no funding source identified (budget cannot exceed revenue without explicit borrowing).
```

**Approved Example:**
```
APPROVED
```
```

## Narrative Explaining Changes

### The paper that changed the meeting
January brought a preprint no health minister had asked for: a genome model outlining a viable human-infecting design, with methods detailed enough for a skilled non-expert to follow. Virologists argued over methods on mailing lists and in press columns, accusing the authors of alarmism and of printing too much at once. Inside Berlaymont, the argument landed differently. With the most capable open weights already able to run multi-day projects and safety assurance near absent, containment inside Europe looked like the only lever that could move in time.

### A proposal, not yet a surge
HERA and the disease control centre were tasked to prepare a new surge through a Health Council mandate proposal: hospital sequencing labs to receive funded capacity, audit teams to be stood up, synthesis providers to face mandatory screening checks, and mutual-aid stockpiles to be topped up. The mandate was adopted as a proposal in principle, but implementation is phased over coming turns and delayed until resources are secured.

Funding is not yet secured. Shifting existing cohesion health lines was discussed as a partial source, but no named budget reallocation, drawdown, or borrowing was agreed this turn to cover audit teams, screening infrastructure, and expanded hospital operating costs. Finance ministers deferred the funding decision to the next budget round, so no new disbursements flowed. Without funding committed, the proposal generates no legitimacy dividend yet, and political recognition will have to wait for a resourced commitment.

Staffing is a second constraint. Biosecurity auditors, lab technicians, and compliance officers cannot be hired and trained within six months at this scale, and no pre-existing surge capacity or emergency deployment protocol was invoked. HERA began drafting staffing plans and pilot screening designs, with large university hospitals scoped for first pilots and smaller clinics flagging unfunded paperwork risks. Until hiring and training pipelines are funded and initiated, no implementation progress can be recorded. Two synthesis firms lobbied against the draft checks, including talk of routing orders through Swiss intermediaries.

The logistics file would not stay quiet. The wage-insurance offices in the two hub cities paid slowly and turned away parcel sorters on short contracts. Wildcat talk returned after a night-shift injury involving a sorting arm, and for two evenings freight slowed at one port before works councils talked crews back. No full stoppage, but managers kept contingency buses ready.

### Concrete without current
The gigafactory zones stayed fenced. With new spend frozen to guarantees already signed, grid-connection talks stalled and American suppliers kept European buyers on longer queues and higher prices. Trade shuttles to Tokyo and Seoul kept evaluation papers circulating but produced no quotas. The middle-power coalition effort formally closed, yielding contacts and a joint statement rather than capacity.

Europe ended June with a bio-containment plan on paper it hopes to fund and staff, and no closer to powering its own frontier models. The plan remains a proposal only, with effects to materialize over a minimum of two turns once funding and staffing are in place.

## Game Master's Notepad (persistent record)

PORTFOLIO CHARGE t8: M9 EU Logistics Worker Transition Shield −2, M10 EU Bio-Uplift Containment Surge −2, priority −1 = −5
PROPOSAL BONUS: EU Bio-Uplift Containment Surge (cat 6, small) +4 — answers bio_uplift_findings precursor this turn directly, severe signal opening 4-turn gate, small domestic resilience measure
LEGITIMACY LENDS: capital 22, sentiment 26 -> +2
SOVEREIGNTY: 17 last turn, no cat4 finishes, no cat4 in flight +0, no capacity event, capability rose 1.0 −0 = 17

This is the authoritative record of what has already happened in this run. A constraint phrased as "once X has occurred" is satisfied if the notepad records X, even when this turn's narrative does not mention it. Check the notepad before concluding that something has not happened.

---

Check if this update respects all Constitutional Constraints. Respond with either "APPROVED" or "VIOLATIONS: [list specific violations]".

Treat approval as a hard gate. If an explicit constraint is broken, do not wave it through because the broader narrative feels reasonable.
