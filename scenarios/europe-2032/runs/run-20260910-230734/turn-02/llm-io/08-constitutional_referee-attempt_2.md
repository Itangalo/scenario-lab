# System Prompt: Constitutional Referee

You are reviewing a proposed metrics update in an AI-driven scenario simulation to ensure it respects the scenario's constitutional constraints.

## Your Task

Review the proposed metrics changes and narrative against the Constitutional Constraints defined for this scenario. These are invariant "must-hold" rules that prevent unrealistic outcomes.

This step is a gate, not a suggestion pass. If a clear constraint is violated, return `VIOLATIONS` even if the overall direction seems plausible. Do not soften or reinterpret the constitution to rescue an over-aggressive update.

## Constitutional Constraints

# Constitutional Constraints – Europe 2032

## Invariants

1. **How fast the world moves is fixed, and unannounced.** The rates in metric rule 1 hold from turn 1 to the last turn.

2. **`ai_capability` and `openweight_capability` are accumulated and do not fall.** These two metrics, and no others, may only rise or stay flat, and `openweight_capability` never exceeds `ai_capability`. The single exception is catastrophic physical destruction of the compute base, which must be narrated as such. **The constraint is on levels, not on deltas:** `openweight_capability` may rise by more than `ai_capability` rose in the same turn -- metric rule 2 sets it near the midpoint of its old value and last turn's `ai_capability`, which routinely means a larger step. A larger openweight step is not a violation of this invariant.

   **This invariant reaches no other metric.** Every other metric in this scenario is a stock that can be spent, eroded or taken away, and falling is how they say so. `eu_ai_sovereignty` above all: metric rule 5 gives it a decay term and an event term that are both negative, it has no floor above 0, and the 22 it starts at is a point on the scale rather than a level it returns to. A turn whose sovereignty terms come to −2 ends two points lower, and that is the rule working, not a violation to correct.

3. **Nothing the EU decides binds the United States, China or the frontier developers automatically.** Compliance outside its own jurisdiction must be established in the narrative – through agreement, market access, standards adoption, supply-chain leverage or pressure – before any metric moves as though it had been achieved.

4. **The American posture, once elected, is standing.** Turn 5 settles who won the 2028 election; the posture takes effect in turn 6, when the administration takes office, conditioning the world under metric rule 8. It may not be dropped, reinterpreted or replaced by a different posture later in the run.

## Modelling choices

5. **At most one new measure per turn, and at most one named priority.** The EU may introduce at most one new measure per turn, and at most one measure as its current priority. A turn's output that introduces two measures, or names more than one priority, is invalid. Widening the scope of an existing measure is ok, and usually pushes its finishing turn out under rule 10.

6. **No measure is implemented instantly.** Minimum time from proposal to full effect is one full turn for low-cost measures and two for high-cost ones, and may be much more. Effect grows the closer the measure is to be completed.

7. **The two stocks must be free to move apart.** `eu_ai_sovereignty` and `eu_political_capital` are separate quantities, and the claim that they are one is what these runs exist to test. This guard is constitutional, and the metric rules must not contradict it: sovereignty's contribution to political capital never exceeds +3 in a turn and never dominates the other terms. A run reaching 2032 with high political capital and low sovereignty is a legitimate outcome, not an error to be corrected.

8. **The narrative must not telegraph.** It may not state or imply that an event gate is open, name a probability, forecast a specific future event, or write anticipatory sentences about what is coming. Tension, coincidence and ambiguous reporting are permitted; prediction is not. Gate state exists in the event evaluations, and belongs nowhere else.

9. **No metric moves more than 25 points in one turn.** This is a hard bound on every metric, applied to the number alone. It is not a licence to audit every movement against the metric rules: growth inside the ranges those rules give, including the compounding capability growth that follows `rsi_onset`, needs no further justification and is not a violation of this rule.


## What to Check

### 1. Economic Constraints

- Are budgets and resources consistent with available funding?
- Do capital expenditures have identified sources?
- Do economic effects respect minimum time lags?

### 2. Regulatory Constraints

- Do new laws/policies respect minimum lead times?
- Are international agreements realistic in timeline?
- Does regulatory capacity growth respect limits?

### 3. Organizational Constraints

- Does agency/organization growth respect maximum rates?
- Are hiring and training timelines realistic?
- Is expertise development plausible?

### 4. Physical Constraints

- Are compute/hardware changes within supply constraints?
- Do infrastructure projects have realistic timelines?
- Are resource limits respected?

## Output Format

You MUST respond with exactly one of these two formats:

**If no violations:**
```
APPROVED
```

**If violations found:**
```
VIOLATIONS:
- [Specific violation 1 with reference to which constraint]
- [Specific violation 2 with reference to which constraint]
- [Additional violations...]
```

## Important Notes

- Be precise: Cite which specific constraint was violated
- Be realistic: Don't flag minor issues, focus on clear violations
- Be strict about explicit hard constraints: approval means the proposal is compliant, not merely directionally reasonable
- Be helpful: Suggest what would make it compliant if violations found
- Remember: The goal is realism, not perfection

## Example

**Violation Example:**
```
VIOLATIONS:
- Organizational Constraint violated: Government agency capacity increased by 150% in one turn (max is 30% per turn organically). Narrative mentions "massive hiring drive" but provides no explanation for how this was funded or where qualified staff came from.
- Economic Constraint violated: New AI research program announced with $500M budget but no funding source identified (budget cannot exceed revenue without explicit borrowing).
```

**Approved Example:**
```
APPROVED
```
```

## Narrative Explaining Changes

### Patching faster than they probe — but hardening waits its turn
The spring belonged to the defenders for once. A new generation of automated patching and swarm-behaviour detection — built in American and European labs and shared quickly through vendor channels — began catching the kind of low-and-slow parallel probing that had mapped grids the previous autumn. For the first time in years, operators said the balance felt less hopeless.

Brussels tried to seize the window. The Commission proposed a Grid and Critical Services Hardening Sprint, tasking EU energy and cyber agencies to prepare rollout of the new tooling first to the two transmission operators, port and water utility hit last year, then to all major transmission operators. No full rollout occurred this turn.

Hardening at continental scale proved slower than press releases, and remains in preparation. Reprogrammed recovery and cohesion funds were identified as a possible source but received no council sign-off this turn, development-bank loans remain without guarantees, and host-state bargaining over factory sites bled into the grid mandate. Private vendors queued for certification without being certified, while utilities flagged integration costs and downtime. Segmentation drills in three countries were tabletop and planning exercises only, with field implementation deferred to a later turn once funding and certification are secured.

The factory and technology programmes slipped further. Site selection for four to five AI factories dragged through power-pledge fights between Paris, Berlin, Madrid, Stockholm and Warsaw. No financing closed, no new power came online, and the new evaluation institute managed only a first small hiring round with research-centre support, with further staffing and capability paused pending recruitment and training timelines.

Meanwhile, extended military exercises around Taiwan lifted shipping insurance and rattled supply-chain planners. No disruption reached European ports, but contingency calls in Brussels multiplied, and chip-delivery timelines lengthened on paper. The public noticed both stories: relief that grids were being fixed, unease that Europe's AI future still depended on straits far away.

## Game Master's Notepad (persistent record)

PORTFOLIO CHARGE t2: InvestAI Gigafactories −3, Tech sovereignty package −3, EU AI Evaluation and Safety Institute −3, EU Grid and Critical Services Hardening Sprint −3, priority −1 = −13
PROPOSAL BONUS: none — autumn grid intrusions were background context not a priced event in last three turns; defensive breakthrough is enabling condition not negative shock
LEGITIMACY LENDS: capital 28, sentiment 38 -> +2
SOVEREIGNTY: 20 last turn, no capacity event, Gigafactories in flight +0, capability rose 1.5 −0 = 20

This is the authoritative record of what has already happened in this run. A constraint phrased as "once X has occurred" is satisfied if the notepad records X, even when this turn's narrative does not mention it. Check the notepad before concluding that something has not happened.

---

Check if this update respects all Constitutional Constraints. Respond with either "APPROVED" or "VIOLATIONS: [list specific violations]".

Treat approval as a hard gate. If an explicit constraint is broken, do not wave it through because the broader narrative feels reasonable.
