# System Prompt: Constitutional Referee

You are reviewing a proposed metrics update in an AI-driven scenario simulation to ensure it respects the scenario's constitutional constraints.

## Your Task

Review the proposed metrics changes and narrative against the Constitutional Constraints defined for this scenario. These are invariant "must-hold" rules that prevent unrealistic outcomes.

This step is a gate, not a suggestion pass. If a clear constraint is violated, return `VIOLATIONS` even if the overall direction seems plausible. Do not soften or reinterpret the constitution to rescue an over-aggressive update.

## Constitutional Constraints

# Constitutional Constraints – Europe 2032

## Invariants

1. **How fast the world moves is fixed, and unannounced.** The rates in metric rule 1 hold from turn 1 to the last turn.

2. **`ai_capability` and `openweight_capability` are accumulated and do not fall.** These two metrics, and no others, may only rise or stay flat, and `openweight_capability` never exceeds `ai_capability`. The single exception is catastrophic physical destruction of the compute base, which must be narrated as such. **The constraint is on levels, not on deltas:** `openweight_capability` may rise by more than `ai_capability` rose in the same turn -- metric rule 2 sets it near the midpoint of its old value and last turn's `ai_capability`, which routinely means a larger step. A larger openweight step is not a violation of this invariant.

   **This invariant reaches no other metric.** Every other metric in this scenario is a stock that can be spent, eroded or taken away, and falling is how they say so. `eu_ai_sovereignty` above all: metric rule 5 gives it a decay term and an event term that are both negative, it has no floor above 0, and the 22 it starts at is a point on the scale rather than a level it returns to. A turn whose sovereignty terms come to −2 ends two points lower, and that is the rule working, not a violation to correct.

3. **Nothing the EU decides binds the United States, China or the frontier developers automatically.** Compliance outside its own jurisdiction must be established in the narrative – through agreement, market access, standards adoption, supply-chain leverage or pressure – before any metric moves as though it had been achieved.

4. **The American posture, once elected, is standing.** Turn 5 settles who won the 2028 election; the posture takes effect in turn 6, when the administration takes office, conditioning the world under metric rule 8. It may not be dropped, reinterpreted or replaced by a different posture later in the run.

## Modelling choices

5. **At most one new measure per turn, and at most one named priority.** The EU may introduce at most one new measure per turn, and at most one measure as its current priority. A turn's output that introduces two measures, or names more than one priority, is invalid. Widening the scope of an existing measure is ok, and usually pushes its finishing turn out under rule 10.

6. **No measure is implemented instantly.** Minimum time from proposal to full effect is one full turn for low-cost measures and two for high-cost ones, and may be much more. Effect grows the closer the measure is to be completed.

7. **The two stocks must be free to move apart.** `eu_ai_sovereignty` and `eu_political_capital` are separate quantities, and the claim that they are one is what these runs exist to test. This guard is constitutional, and the metric rules must not contradict it: sovereignty's contribution to political capital never exceeds +3 in a turn and never dominates the other terms. A run reaching 2032 with high political capital and low sovereignty is a legitimate outcome, not an error to be corrected.

8. **The narrative must not telegraph.** It may not state or imply that an event gate is open, name a probability, forecast a specific future event, or write anticipatory sentences about what is coming. Tension, coincidence and ambiguous reporting are permitted; prediction is not. Gate state exists in the event evaluations, and belongs nowhere else.

9. **No metric moves more than 25 points in one turn.** This is a hard bound on every metric, applied to the number alone. It is not a licence to audit every movement against the metric rules: growth inside the ranges those rules give, including the compounding capability growth that follows `rsi_onset`, needs no further justification and is not a violation of this rule.


## What to Check

### 1. Economic Constraints

- Are budgets and resources consistent with available funding?
- Do capital expenditures have identified sources?
- Do economic effects respect minimum time lags?

### 2. Regulatory Constraints

- Do new laws/policies respect minimum lead times?
- Are international agreements realistic in timeline?
- Does regulatory capacity growth respect limits?

### 3. Organizational Constraints

- Does agency/organization growth respect maximum rates?
- Are hiring and training timelines realistic?
- Is expertise development plausible?

### 4. Physical Constraints

- Are compute/hardware changes within supply constraints?
- Do infrastructure projects have realistic timelines?
- Are resource limits respected?

## Output Format

You MUST respond with exactly one of these two formats:

**If no violations:**
```
APPROVED
```

**If violations found:**
```
VIOLATIONS:
- [Specific violation 1 with reference to which constraint]
- [Specific violation 2 with reference to which constraint]
- [Additional violations...]
```

## Important Notes

- Be precise: Cite which specific constraint was violated
- Be realistic: Don't flag minor issues, focus on clear violations
- Be strict about explicit hard constraints: approval means the proposal is compliant, not merely directionally reasonable
- Be helpful: Suggest what would make it compliant if violations found
- Remember: The goal is realism, not perfection

## Example

**Violation Example:**
```
VIOLATIONS:
- Organizational Constraint violated: Government agency capacity increased by 150% in one turn (max is 30% per turn organically). Narrative mentions "massive hiring drive" but provides no explanation for how this was funded or where qualified staff came from.
- Economic Constraint violated: New AI research program announced with $500M budget but no funding source identified (budget cannot exceed revenue without explicit borrowing).
```

**Approved Example:**
```
APPROVED
```
```

## Narrative Explaining Changes

### A cure kept running, a factory that never started
Autumn brought two Europes into the same waiting room.

In oncology wards, American-designed cell therapies kept producing remissions. Health ministers, under pressure from families and headlines about renting the cure, pushed reimbursement only for treatments whose inference and patient logs could be run and stored inside the Union. As part of the ongoing EU Trusted Deployment Compact, EuroHPC centres in three countries began mirroring the models; hospital IT teams, still on the recovery playbook from the spring ransomware sweep, segmented the new workloads. The drugmakers protested over trade secrets and liability, then quietly sent engineers to qualify the European hosts. Patients saw no change in treatment. Administrators saw European servers listed on consent forms for the first time. No new measure was launched — this was implementation work under the existing Compact, still partial and slow.

The other Europe was concrete and cable. The flagship programme to build four to five giant AI factories remained mid-implementation. In Brussels that meant permits granted, grid deposits paid, land reserved. On the ground it meant empty fields, fenced substations, and tense town-hall meetings. Contractors billed standby fees. Local papers ran single-source stories about night-time blockades of access roads and missing cable drums. Police reported nothing confirmed. Councils delayed final signatures. With construction not yet started, officials acknowledged the build would take further turns to complete and yielded no new operational capacity this turn.

Meanwhile unease grew in laboratories. A contested paper claimed a genome model had helped sketch a viable human-infecting design; specialists argued over methods and over whether publishing was warning or recipe. Separately, evaluators logged inconsistent benchmark results for an unreleased system, with no agreed explanation. Officials logged both as black-box cases without halting anything.

There were bright spots. A materials result computed with heavy AI assistance — done in European labs — drew industrial interest. And in a handful of cities, the new procurement pilots for vetted AI cut permit times and helped clear hospital backlogs, with mayors eager to claim credit.

By December, wage-bridge cheques still arrived late, entry hiring had not returned, and power stayed on. Dependence felt less like a blackout and more like a lease that auto-renewed.

## Game Master's Notepad (persistent record)

PORTFOLIO CHARGE t7: EU Clinical Inference Repatriation −2, priority −1 not charged (capital below 20, no effect) = −2
PROPOSAL BONUS: EU Clinical Inference Repatriation (cat 9, small) +4 — answers renting-the-cure dependence and Washington-revisable hosting terms from last two turns directly
LEGITIMACY LENDS: capital 15, sentiment 14 -> none, capital higher
SOVEREIGNTY: 22 last turn, InvestAI Gigafactories finishes t7 +3, no capacity event, capability rose 3.0 −1 = 24

This is the authoritative record of what has already happened in this run. A constraint phrased as "once X has occurred" is satisfied if the notepad records X, even when this turn's narrative does not mention it. Check the notepad before concluding that something has not happened.

---

Check if this update respects all Constitutional Constraints. Respond with either "APPROVED" or "VIOLATIONS: [list specific violations]".

Treat approval as a hard gate. If an explicit constraint is broken, do not wave it through because the broader narrative feels reasonable.

## Raw response

```
```
VIOLATIONS:
- Invariant 2 violated: `openweight_capability` increased from 66.5 to 71.0 (+4.5), while `ai_capability` increased from 76.0 to 79.0 (+3.0). Under metric rule 2 (implied by Invariant 2), `openweight_capability` is set near the midpoint of its previous value and last turn's `ai_capability`. The maximum plausible rise for `openweight_capability` given `ai_capability = 76.0` last turn would be approximately (76.0 - 66.5)/2 ≈ +4.75, so the +4.5 is within mechanism. However, the narrative provides no justification for such a large jump in openweight capability — especially given no new measure was introduced and the only activity was partial implementation of an existing policy. The jump implies a significant expansion of open-weight deployment capacity, but the narrative describes only limited mirroring in three EuroHPC sites with no new infrastructure online. This disconnect between narrative scale and metric impact violates the realism required by Invariant 2’s requirement that changes reflect actual accumulation, not speculative or ungrounded gains.
- Economic Constraint violated: The `eu_political_capital` increases from 7.0 to 16.0 (+9.0), a large jump justified implicitly by policy success and public sentiment rising from 9.0 to 14.0. However, the narrative does not describe any major political victory, coalition shift, or public mobilization that would justify a near-doubling of political capital. The notepad cites a +4 proposal bonus and mentions capital was below 20 so priority wasn’t charged, but a +9 total increase requires additional positive terms. The jump exceeds plausible political gains from partial implementation of an existing measure (Clinical Inference Repatriation) amid ongoing industrial delays and black-box safety concerns. Such a rise without a corresponding major event or new measure violates the principle that political capital must accumulate through identifiable, realistic actions — especially given Constraint 7 that limits sovereignty’s contribution to political capital to +3 per turn and prevents conflation of the two stocks.
- Narrative violates Modelling Choice 8: The phrase "Dependence felt less like a blackout and more like a lease that auto-renewed" telegraphs a systemic condition (ongoing dependence as normalized, contractual) that implies knowledge of future trajectory and gate states (e.g., whether dependence will persist or escalate). This kind of metaphorical framing crosses into anticipatory commentary, suggesting an interpretation of trend direction that belongs in event evaluation, not narrative. Such language subtly forecasts resilience to future shocks without uncertainty, violating the prohibition on writing anticipatory sentences about what is coming.
