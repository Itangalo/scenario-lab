# System Prompt: Constitutional Referee

You are reviewing a proposed metrics update in an AI-driven scenario simulation to ensure it respects the scenario's constitutional constraints.

## Your Task

Review the proposed metrics changes and narrative against the Constitutional Constraints defined for this scenario. These are invariant "must-hold" rules that prevent unrealistic outcomes.

This step is a gate, not a suggestion pass. If a clear constraint is violated, return `VIOLATIONS` even if the overall direction seems plausible. Do not soften or reinterpret the constitution to rescue an over-aggressive update.

## Constitutional Constraints

# Constitutional Constraints – Europe 2032

## Invariants

1. **How fast the world moves is fixed, and unannounced.** The rates in metric rule 1 hold from turn 1 to the last turn.

2. **`ai_capability` and `openweight_capability` are accumulated and do not fall.** These two metrics, and no others, may only rise or stay flat, and `openweight_capability` never exceeds `ai_capability`. The single exception is catastrophic physical destruction of the compute base, which must be narrated as such. **The constraint is on levels, not on deltas:** `openweight_capability` may rise by more than `ai_capability` rose in the same turn -- metric rule 2 sets it near the midpoint of its old value and last turn's `ai_capability`, which routinely means a larger step. A larger openweight step is not a violation of this invariant.

   **This invariant reaches no other metric.** Every other metric in this scenario is a stock that can be spent, eroded or taken away, and falling is how they say so. `eu_ai_sovereignty` above all: metric rule 5 gives it a decay term and an event term that are both negative, it has no floor above 0, and the 22 it starts at is a point on the scale rather than a level it returns to. A turn whose sovereignty terms come to −2 ends two points lower, and that is the rule working, not a violation to correct.

3. **Nothing the EU decides binds the United States, China or the frontier developers automatically.** Compliance outside its own jurisdiction must be established in the narrative – through agreement, market access, standards adoption, supply-chain leverage or pressure – before any metric moves as though it had been achieved.

4. **The American posture, once elected, is standing.** Turn 5 settles who won the 2028 election; the posture takes effect in turn 6, when the administration takes office, conditioning the world under metric rule 8. It may not be dropped, reinterpreted or replaced by a different posture later in the run.

## Modelling choices

5. **At most one new measure per turn, and at most one named priority.** The EU may introduce at most one new measure per turn, and at most one measure as its current priority. A turn's output that introduces two measures, or names more than one priority, is invalid. Widening the scope of an existing measure is ok, and usually pushes its finishing turn out under rule 10.

6. **No measure is implemented instantly.** Minimum time from proposal to full effect is one full turn for low-cost measures and two for high-cost ones, and may be much more. Effect grows the closer the measure is to be completed.

7. **The two stocks must be free to move apart.** `eu_ai_sovereignty` and `eu_political_capital` are separate quantities, and the claim that they are one is what these runs exist to test. This guard is constitutional, and the metric rules must not contradict it: sovereignty's contribution to political capital never exceeds +3 in a turn and never dominates the other terms. A run reaching 2032 with high political capital and low sovereignty is a legitimate outcome, not an error to be corrected.

8. **The narrative must not telegraph.** It may not state or imply that an event gate is open, name a probability, forecast a specific future event, or write anticipatory sentences about what is coming. Tension, coincidence and ambiguous reporting are permitted; prediction is not. Gate state exists in the event evaluations, and belongs nowhere else.

9. **No metric moves more than 25 points in one turn.** This is a hard bound on every metric, applied to the number alone. It is not a licence to audit every movement against the metric rules: growth inside the ranges those rules give, including the compounding capability growth that follows `rsi_onset`, needs no further justification and is not a violation of this rule.


## What to Check

### 1. Economic Constraints

- Are budgets and resources consistent with available funding?
- Do capital expenditures have identified sources?
- Do economic effects respect minimum time lags?

### 2. Regulatory Constraints

- Do new laws/policies respect minimum lead times?
- Are international agreements realistic in timeline?
- Does regulatory capacity growth respect limits?

### 3. Organizational Constraints

- Does agency/organization growth respect maximum rates?
- Are hiring and training timelines realistic?
- Is expertise development plausible?

### 4. Physical Constraints

- Are compute/hardware changes within supply constraints?
- Do infrastructure projects have realistic timelines?
- Are resource limits respected?

## Output Format

You MUST respond with exactly one of these two formats:

**If no violations:**
```
APPROVED
```

**If violations found:**
```
VIOLATIONS:
- [Specific violation 1 with reference to which constraint]
- [Specific violation 2 with reference to which constraint]
- [Additional violations...]
```

## Important Notes

- Be precise: Cite which specific constraint was violated
- Be realistic: Don't flag minor issues, focus on clear violations
- Be strict about explicit hard constraints: approval means the proposal is compliant, not merely directionally reasonable
- Be helpful: Suggest what would make it compliant if violations found
- Remember: The goal is realism, not perfection

## Example

**Violation Example:**
```
VIOLATIONS:
- Organizational Constraint violated: Government agency capacity increased by 150% in one turn (max is 30% per turn organically). Narrative mentions "massive hiring drive" but provides no explanation for how this was funded or where qualified staff came from.
- Economic Constraint violated: New AI research program announced with $500M budget but no funding source identified (budget cannot exceed revenue without explicit borrowing).
```

**Approved Example:**
```
APPROVED
```
```

## Narrative Explaining Changes

### The wave breaks
Autumn brought the attack everyone had rehearsed for and no one contained. A largely automated ransomware sweep, built with freely available tooling, moved through municipal systems, hospitals and contractors in the same week. Services went dark in dozens of cities. Clean-up crews found the entry points were familiar — helpdesk impersonation with cloned voices, a poisoned software update — only now at machine speed and scale.

Places that had finished offline-backup drills restored in days; others waited weeks. Television ran queues at town halls alongside maps of outages. Insurers hardened their line: future municipal cover would require proof of offline backups and alignment with Union hardening guidance. Safety institutions were strained by the response and offensive diffusion eroded margins, but oversight boards, red-teaming and regulation remained in place.

### The frontier copies itself
In the middle of the clean-up, two shocks compounded it. A leading lab demonstrated a sharp jump in code and intrusion capability, immediately copied into attack scripts. Weeks later a near-frontier open release was downloaded hundreds of thousands of times in days. What had been a lab edge was now on private hardware everywhere, with openweight capability edging upward in the wake of prior frontier gains.

Brussels answered with one new measure this turn: a containment pact — Union-funded restoration teams, pre-positioned clean images, and cross-border mutual aid run through the joint cyber centre, with recovery money conditioned on backups and isolation drills. The earlier upstream leverage work continued in the background but no second new measure was launched. The pact started fast but thin — teams arrived after the worst outages, and mayors complained aid came with paperwork, delaying full effect.

### Tightening vise
Washington tightened chip and model controls again. Under the inward-turned administration, licences were drawn so tightly that even allied buyers were rationed. The Dutch servicing dispute festered, pooled spares for Japanese and Korean suppliers bought only trickles of accelerators, and the shared stockpile thinned.

The gigafactory programme formally closed on paper — permits, grid connections, insurance — but with no new concrete poured while parts were frozen. Ministers called the sites ready; press called them fields. With no hardware built or activated, it delivered no gain in strategic autonomy this turn, and supply coercion offset any administrative close-out. Talk of a separate side-deal by one capital faded without signature, but left distrust.

By December trust in AI hit a new low, and the Union's room to act narrowed to holding the line.

## Game Master's Notepad (persistent record)

PORTFOLIO CHARGE t7: M6 EU Upstream Leverage Coalition −2, M7 EU Automated Disruption Containment Pact −2, priority −1 = −5
PROPOSAL BONUS: EU Automated Disruption Containment Pact (cat 6, small) +3 — cyber_major_incident this turn severe and this answers it directly
LEGITIMACY LENDS: capital 7, sentiment 19 -> +2
SOVEREIGNTY: 20 last turn, M1 InvestAI Gigafactories finishes t7 +4, no capacity in-flight bonus +0, export_control_escalation t7 −2, capability rose 1.2 no penalty = 22

This is the authoritative record of what has already happened in this run. A constraint phrased as "once X has occurred" is satisfied if the notepad records X, even when this turn's narrative does not mention it. Check the notepad before concluding that something has not happened.

Check if this update respects all Constitutional Constraints. Respond with either "APPROVED" or "VIOLATIONS: [list specific violations]".

Treat approval as a hard gate. If an explicit constraint is broken, do not wave it through because the broader narrative feels reasonable.

## Raw response

```
```
VIOLATIONS:
- Invariant 2 violated: `ai_capability` increased from 61.8 to 63.0 (+1.2), which is permissible, but the narrative attributes a "sharp jump in code and intrusion capability" that was "immediately copied into attack scripts" and led to a broad diffusion of advanced capabilities. However, `openweight_capability` only increased by 0.5 (from 58.0 to 58.5), which is inconsistent with the described event. Given the narrative of a major frontier leap being rapidly and widely disseminated — "downloaded hundreds of thousands of times in days" — and the constitutional requirement that `openweight_capability` moves toward the midpoint of its prior value and last turn’s `ai_capability`, the update to `openweight_capability` is too small. Even under conservative uptake, a jump in frontier capability followed by mass adoption of a near-frontier open release should produce a larger step in openweight capability. The metric fails to reflect the scale of diffusion described.
- Economic Constraint violated: The narrative states the InvestAI Gigafactories programme "formally closed on paper" with permits, grid connections, and insurance finalized, but "no new concrete poured" and "no hardware built or activated". Despite this, the Game Master's Notepad applies a +4 sovereignty bonus for "M1 InvestAI Gigafactories finishes t7". This contradicts Modelling Choice 6: "No measure is implemented instantly. Minimum time from proposal to full effect is one full turn for low-cost measures and two for high-cost ones..." A high-cost infrastructure programme like gigafactories cannot deliver sovereignty gains at the moment of administrative close-out if no physical implementation occurred. The gain must be deferred until actual deployment begins, per the rule that effect grows as the measure nears completion, not at paper completion without deployment.
- Invariant 9 violated: `public_sentiment` drops from 26.0 to 19.0 (a change of −7.0), which is within bounds, but `eu_political_capital` drops from 14.0 to 9.0 (−5.0), and `ai_safety` from 23.0 to 20.0 (−3.0), while `resilience` falls from 44.0 to 42.0 (−2.0). These are acceptable individually, but the Game Master's Notepad calculates `eu_ai_sovereignty` as 22, implying a net +2 change from 20.0. However, the proposed new metric is 20.0 — unchanged. This discrepancy between the notepad (which says +4 from gigafactory finish, −2 from export_control_escalation, net +2 → 22) and the proposed metric (still 20.0) violates the requirement that metric updates be consistent with the authoritative notepad. Either the notepad is wrong (and must be corrected) or the metric must reflect the calculated value. As written, the update is internally inconsistent, breaking the integrity of the record.
