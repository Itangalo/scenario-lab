validation_model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"

checks:
  actor_decision_consistency:
    enabled: true
    severity: "medium"
    description: |
      Validate that actor decisions align with their stated goals, constraints,
      expertise levels, and decision-making styles.

      Key checks:
      - Mayor should prioritize political viability and re-election
      - Tech company should push products while managing reputation risk
      - Privacy advocate should oppose surveillance-heavy applications
      - Citizens should represent diverse community concerns

  world_state_coherence:
    enabled: true
    severity: "high"
    description: |
      Validate that world state updates logically follow from actor decisions
      and show realistic consequences.

      Key checks:
      - Budget changes should match spending decisions
      - Public opinion should respond to actions (positive or negative)
      - Political dynamics should evolve realistically
      - Timeline should be plausible (not too fast or slow)

  information_access_consistency:
    enabled: true
    severity: "high"
    description: |
      Validate that actors only reference information they have access to.

      Key checks:
      - Actors shouldn't know private information from others
      - Public information should be available to all
      - Communications should respect visibility rules
      - Background information should be accessible as specified

  goal_progress_tracking:
    enabled: true
    severity: "low"
    description: |
      Track whether actors are making progress toward their stated goals
      or if they're acting inconsistently with their objectives.

      This is a softer check - actors may sometimes act suboptimally,
      but sustained patterns of counterproductive behavior suggest problems.
