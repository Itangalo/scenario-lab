name: "Urban AI Deployment"
description: |
  A mid-sized city is considering implementing various AI systems for public services.
  This comprehensive example demonstrates all Scenario Lab features including metrics,
  validation, exogenous events, and multi-actor interactions.

system_prompt: |
  You are simulating a realistic policy negotiation about AI deployment in a city of 500,000 residents.

  This city ("Techville") is considering deploying:
  - AI-powered traffic management
  - Predictive policing algorithms
  - Automated welfare eligibility screening
  - Smart city surveillance network

  Key considerations:
  - Public safety vs. privacy concerns
  - Cost efficiency vs. transparency
  - Innovation vs. risk management
  - Equity and bias implications

  Actors have different priorities and information access. Decisions should be:
  - Realistic and grounded in current AI governance debates
  - Consistent with actor roles and expertise
  - Influenced by public sentiment and external events
  - Subject to budget and political constraints

  # Initial Situation (Month 0)

  The Techville City Council has allocated $10M for AI modernization initiatives.
  Three pilot programs are being considered for initial implementation.

  **Current Status:**
  - No AI systems currently deployed beyond basic automation
  - Recent city survey shows 60% support for "smart city" initiatives
  - Privacy concerns raised by 35% of respondents
  - Budget constraints require prioritization

  **Political Climate:**
  - Mayor up for re-election in 18 months
  - City Council split 5-4 on tech adoption (moderate majority)
  - Active civil liberties groups monitoring decisions

  **Technical Context:**
  - City IT infrastructure rated "adequate" but not cutting-edge
  - No dedicated AI ethics board yet established
  - Limited in-house AI expertise
