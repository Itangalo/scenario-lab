# METRICS CONFIGURATION
# Metrics allow you to track quantitative and qualitative outcomes across scenario runs.
# This is especially useful for batch experiments where you compare variations.

scenario_name: "Example: AI Safety Policy Negotiation"

metrics:
  # EXAMPLE 1: Numeric metric with regex extraction
  # This automatically extracts FLOPS values from generated text.
  # Pattern explanation: matches formats like "10^25 FLOPS" or "1.5 × 10^26 FLOPS"
  compute_threshold_flops:
    description: "FLOPS threshold that triggers regulation (key negotiation parameter)"
    type: "float"
    unit: "FLOPS"
    extraction_method: "regex"
    # This regex matches scientific notation: captures base number and exponent
    pattern: '(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*[×x]\s*10\^(\d+)\s*FLOPS?'
    actor_specific: false

  # EXAMPLE 2: Simple integer metric with regex
  # Extracts timeline values from text like "24 hours" or "72-hour reporting"
  incident_reporting_hours:
    description: "Required timeline for incident reporting (hours)"
    type: "integer"
    unit: "hours"
    extraction_method: "regex"
    # Matches patterns like "24 hours", "72-hour", "48 hour reporting"
    pattern: '(\d+)\s*[-]?hours?'
    actor_specific: false

  # EXAMPLE 3: Boolean metric with regex
  # Checks if specific concepts appear in the negotiation
  third_party_audits_required:
    description: "Whether mandatory third-party audits were agreed"
    type: "boolean"
    extraction_method: "regex"
    # Matches various phrasings of third-party audit requirements
    pattern: 'third[-\s]party\s+audit'
    actor_specific: false

  # EXAMPLE 4: String metric with manual extraction
  # For complex or subjective values that need human judgment
  audit_disclosure_level:
    description: "Level of audit disclosure (public/confidential/summary-only/mixed)"
    type: "string"
    extraction_method: "manual"  # Analyst reviews outputs and sets this value
    actor_specific: false

  # EXAMPLE 5: Manual assessment metric
  # Subjective evaluation on a scale
  compromise_level:
    description: "Degree of compromise reached (1-10 scale, 10 = full agreement)"
    type: "integer"
    extraction_method: "manual"
    actor_specific: false

  # EXAMPLE 6: Actor-specific metric (regulator)
  # Tracks individual actor priorities/emphasis
  regulator_safety_priority:
    description: "Regulator's emphasis on safety vs. flexibility (1-10, 10 = maximum safety focus)"
    type: "integer"
    extraction_method: "manual"
    actor_specific: true
    actor: "National AI Safety Regulator"

  # EXAMPLE 7: Actor-specific metric (company)
  company_innovation_priority:
    description: "Company's emphasis on innovation freedom vs. compliance (1-10, 10 = maximum freedom)"
    type: "integer"
    extraction_method: "manual"
    actor_specific: true
    actor: "FrontierAI Technologies"

  # EXAMPLE 8: Process metric - tracks whether specific mechanisms are proposed
  working_group_proposed:
    description: "Whether a joint working group was proposed"
    type: "boolean"
    extraction_method: "regex"
    pattern: 'working\s+group|joint\s+committee|collaborative\s+body'
    actor_specific: false

  # EXAMPLE 9: Standards reference - tracks mention of specific frameworks
  iso_certification_mentioned:
    description: "Whether ISO 42001 AI management standard was mentioned"
    type: "boolean"
    extraction_method: "regex"
    pattern: 'ISO\s*(?:\/IEC)?\s*42001'
    actor_specific: false

  # EXAMPLE 10: Outcome metric
  regulatory_framework_finalized:
    description: "Whether parties reached a finalized regulatory framework"
    type: "boolean"
    extraction_method: "manual"
    actor_specific: false

# TIPS FOR CREATING METRICS:
# 1. Start with 3-5 key metrics that capture core negotiation outcomes
# 2. Use regex for objective, pattern-based values (numbers, specific terms)
# 3. Use manual extraction for subjective assessments or complex judgments
# 4. Balance automatic and manual metrics (too much manual is time-consuming)
# 5. Test regex patterns on sample text before running full scenarios
# 6. Actor-specific metrics help track individual behavior patterns
# 7. Include both process metrics (what was proposed) and outcome metrics (what was agreed)
