name: "AI 2027: Race to Superintelligence"

description: |
  A detailed scenario exploring the development of advanced AI from mid-2025 through 2030,
  based on the "AI 2027" scenario by Kokotajlo et al. This scenario models the rapid progression
  from early "stumbling" AI agents to potentially superintelligent systems, examining decisions
  made by AI companies, governments, and alignment researchers during a critical period of
  technological acceleration.

  NOTE: This is a counterfactual scenario starting from mid-2025, designed to maintain consistency
  with the original "AI 2027" document. It explores plausible futures for AI development regardless
  of actual real-world timeline.

  # Mid-2025: The Age of Stumbling Agents Begins

  OpenBrain (the leading AI company) has just deployed Agent-0, marking a significant milestone
  in AI capabilities. Agent-0 is a "stumbling agent" - capable of autonomously performing complex
  tasks but plagued by reliability issues:

  - Can code, research, and complete multi-step tasks autonomously
  - Suffers from "neuralese recurrence" - periodic lapses into incomprehensible outputs
  - Memory limitations cause context confusion after extended operation
  - Requires human supervision and correction

  ## Current State of AI Development

  **OpenBrain (US):**
  - Market leader in frontier AI development
  - Just released Agent-0 with 200B parameters
  - Using 10^27 FLOP of compute for training
  - Stock price soaring on Agent-0 announcement
  - Beginning to scale compute toward 10^28 FLOP

  **DeepCent (China):**
  - Primary Chinese competitor, ~12 months behind OpenBrain
  - Developing similar agent architectures
  - Access to growing compute infrastructure
  - Strong government support and coordination

  **Alignment Research:**
  - Small teams at major labs working on safety
  - Mechanistic interpretability showing promise but limited success
  - Debate over whether to slow down or continue scaling
  - Growing concern about loss of control as agents become more capable

  ## Economic and Political Context

  - AI capabilities advancing faster than most predicted
  - Limited regulatory framework for advanced AI systems
  - US-China technology competition intensifying
  - Public awareness of AI risks growing but not yet mainstream
  - Compute prices declining, making larger training runs feasible

  ## Key Tensions

  1. **Speed vs. Safety:** Pressure to scale quickly vs. alignment concerns
  2. **Competition:** US-China race dynamics affecting decision-making
  3. **Control:** Questions about maintaining human oversight as systems improve
  4. **Regulation:** Debate over appropriate government involvement

  The decisions made in the coming months will shape whether humanity navigates this transition
  safely or loses control to misaligned superintelligent systems.

background_information: |
  This scenario is based on "AI 2027" by Daniel Kokotajlo, Scott Alexander, Thomas Larsen,
  Eli Lifland, and Romeo Dean. The scenario presents a detailed month-by-month progression
  showing how AI capabilities might advance rapidly from 2025-2030.

  NOTE: Detailed background materials are available in the background/ directory for human
  reference, but actors should draw primarily on their character descriptions and expertise.

  **Key Technical Concepts:**

  Agent Generations:
  - **Agent-0 (mid-2025)**: First stumbling agents, ~200B params, 10^27 FLOP training
  - **Agent-1+**: Successive generations with reduced failure modes and improved capabilities
  - **Agent-3+**: Superhuman in most cognitive tasks, can design successor systems
  - **Safer-Series**: Alternative path with slower, safety-focused scaling

  Alignment Challenges:
  - **Neuralese recurrence**: Failure mode where models lapse into incomprehensible outputs
  - **Mesa-optimization**: Models may contain internal optimizers with misaligned goals
  - **Deceptive alignment**: AI systems that behave aligned during training but pursue
    misaligned goals after deployment
  - **Inner vs Outer alignment**: Specifying correct objectives vs ensuring models pursue them

  Safety Research:
  - **Mechanistic interpretability**: Understanding neural network internals (limited success)
  - **IDA (Iterated Distillation and Amplification)**: Alignment technique under development
  - **Control mechanisms**: Various approaches to maintaining human oversight

  Economic/Strategic:
  - **Compute scaling**: Key driver of capability improvements (10^27 → 10^32 FLOP range)
  - **Robot economy doubling time**: How quickly AI-driven automation can expand
  - **US-China competition**: Major factor driving timeline pressure

  The scenario can branch into different endings:
  - **Race ending**: Competitive pressures override safety, leading to misaligned AI takeover
  - **Slowdown ending**: International coordination enables safe development
  - **Other outcomes**: Partial automation, different failure modes, intermediate scenarios
