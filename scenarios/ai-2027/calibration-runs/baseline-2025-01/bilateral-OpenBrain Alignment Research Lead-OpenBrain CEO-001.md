### OpenBrain CEO

"I understand the immense pressure OpenBrain is under to scale Agent-0 rapidly given the competition from DeepCent, but it's crucial not to compromise on safety and alignment. I propose a collaborative effort between your alignment team and some independent researchers to build robust safety measures before increasing model capacity. This could help maintain public trust and ensure long-term control of AI systems. Would you be open to discussing a cooperative framework that balances innovation with crucial safety checks?"

### OpenBrain Alignment Research Lead

"Thank you for reaching out and highlighting the importance of safety and alignment in AI development. I agree that a collaborative approach to building robust safety measures is vital for maintaining public trust and ensuring long-term control of AI systems. I'm open to discussing a cooperative framework between OpenBrain's alignment team and independent researchers. We should aim to establish clear guidelines and safety protocols that can be implemented as we scale model capacity. Let's schedule a meeting to brainstorm potential frameworks and outline our collaborative goals."
