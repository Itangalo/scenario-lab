## Current Situation

# Mid-2025: The Age of Stumbling Agents Begins

OpenBrain (the leading AI company) has just deployed Agent-0, marking a significant milestone
in AI capabilities. Agent-0 is a "stumbling agent" - capable of autonomously performing complex
tasks but plagued by reliability issues:

- Can code, research, and complete multi-step tasks autonomously
- Suffers from "neuralese recurrence" - periodic lapses into incomprehensible outputs
- Memory limitations cause context confusion after extended operation
- Requires human supervision and correction

## Current State of AI Development

**OpenBrain (US):**
- Market leader in frontier AI development
- Just released Agent-0 with 200B parameters
- Using 10^27 FLOP of compute for training
- Stock price soaring on Agent-0 announcement
- Beginning to scale compute toward 10^28 FLOP

**DeepCent (China):**
- Primary Chinese competitor, ~12 months behind OpenBrain
- Developing similar agent architectures
- Access to growing compute infrastructure
- Strong government support and coordination

**Alignment Research:**
- Small teams at major labs working on safety
- Mechanistic interpretability showing promise but limited success
- Debate over whether to slow down or continue scaling
- Growing concern about loss of control as agents become more capable

## Economic and Political Context

- AI capabilities advancing faster than most predicted
- Limited regulatory framework for advanced AI systems
- US-China technology competition intensifying
- Public awareness of AI risks growing but not yet mainstream
- Compute prices declining, making larger training runs feasible

## Key Tensions

1. **Speed vs. Safety:** Pressure to scale quickly vs. alignment concerns
2. **Competition:** US-China race dynamics affecting decision-making
3. **Control:** Questions about maintaining human oversight as systems improve
4. **Regulation:** Debate over appropriate government involvement

The decisions made in the coming months will shape whether humanity navigates this transition
safely or loses control to misaligned superintelligent systems.
