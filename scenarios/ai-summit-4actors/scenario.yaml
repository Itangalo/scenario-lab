  ## Setting: London, May 2025

  Four major stakeholders reconvene for intensive AI safety negotiations following
  recent high-profile AI incidents and rapid capability advances.

  **Recent Developments:**
  - Multiple frontier labs achieved GPT-5 class capabilities
  - Two serious AI incidents (medical, financial)
  - EU AI Act enforcement began April 2025
  - US federal regulation stalled in Congress
  - China announced "AI Security Framework"
  - Global public concern at all-time high (72%)

  ## Key Negotiation Issues

  1. **Compute Thresholds** - What training FLOPS trigger oversight? (10^25-10^27 range)
  2. **Pre-Deployment Testing** - Mandatory requirements and who conducts them
  3. **Incident Reporting** - Requirements, timeline (24h-30 days), detail level
  4. **International Coordination** - New institution vs existing bodies, enforcement
  5. **Verification** - Compliance checking without IP exposure

  ## Initial Positions

  - **United States**: Innovation-friendly standards, avoid Chinese advantage
  - **European Union**: Comprehensive risk framework based on AI Act
  - **China**: Respect national sovereignty in AI governance
  - **United Kingdom**: Science-based standards, honest broker role
